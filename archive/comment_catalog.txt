Same.  The only note I'd add is that Neville Chamberlain's answer needs to be understood in the context of World War I, which, especially as seen from the lens of before WWII, seemed to have started from big powers being way too willing to go to war with each other over the treaties about smaller countries.  Chamberlain needs to be understood in the context of somebody who'd never seen World War II, but who had seen World War I and was desperately trying to prevent that very bad terrible worst-case-scenario from repeating itself.

There *are* two reasonable sides to the argument Dumbledore and Harry are having, or so I'd see it myself.  I consider that argument my favorite argument in HPMOR, because I managed to balance the Watsonian considerations exactly enough, and present valid arguments fairly enough, to split the readership almost squarely down the middle and get people actually arguing and thinking about who was right.

This happens in a lot of Lawrence Watt-Evans novels - not quite with "foreshadowing", but with the events making clear sense by story logic; the point, as I'd see it, is that in real life plots don't obey neat dramatic sequences and things can happen because the world works like that, rather than them needing to be foreshadowed.  I continue to think *The Misenchanted Sword* is a nice place to start.

I think you're not fully empathizing with the character, here.  You keep imagining things that a character in a story might do.  What would *you* do?
/r/rational/comments/kxw6i2/d_friday_open_thread/gjfp6x5/




&gt;Setting it directly as they gain the power is a little closer to the action, but given that I want the protagonist to behave somewhat like a real person, they’re almost certainly going to freak out and think they’re hallucinating. That might be more annoying than interesting to read. 

Would you panic and run around in circles in their shoes?  If no, consider upgrading the characters' intelligence and maturity until they're less far below yourself.  If yes, why?  Gamer is testable, just like you say.  In real life I might initially suspect with high probability I was hallucinating, but if my mind otherwise felt absolutely normal, I'd go test that assumption first thing, because my understanding would be that fully realistic hallucinations usually don't go along with all introspective meters reporting inside the interiors of their remembered ranges.

Fact 1:  I served on the founding Board of Directors for the World Transhumanist Association.  I literally don't know who'd count as a transhumanist if I don't.

Fact 2:  At the age of 18, I wrote a crude essay about the surprising realism of "Flowers for Algernon" and how Homo sapiens being in something resembling an evolutionary equilibrium probably implied that any simple huge intelligence enhancement, of a kind that could easily have been implemented by biology, eg altering neurotransmitter balances, would probably, defeasibly, and by default, have some downside that made it a net evolutionary disadvantage in the ancestral environment.  I believe that Nick Bostrom and Anders Sandberg, my seniors in the field, have made similar points in more academic papers.  Anybody who imagines "transhumanists" haven't thoroughly considered points like that is simply ignorant of the relevant literature.

At that level of reasoning, surely there just isn't any such thing as a hard-SF shrink story?

&gt;I don't really see Hermione as the Mary Sue for a few reasons. One is that she has less relative competence than in the original series (where she is acknowledged as something of an author insert). The most important point though is that Mary Suedom primarily comes from distorting the world to make everything about them.

Well, yes, that's exactly *the point of the trope's subversion.*  Mary Sue has everything to do with whether a character distorts the story and very little to do with whether they come back from the dead with pearly-white teeth made of unicorn horn.

&gt; Instead, I think taking a note from Path of Exile-- a tiered economy, with different 'levels' of currency, tied to the power level and needs of particular paths. This could make the magical items of a single tier up literally priceless to the currency below them -- ie, no amount of the wrong type of currency is useful for actually buying certain types of equipment

Ruled out by the Law of One Price and other basic economics.  Unless a 1% chance of getting a tenth of a spirit stone is worth all the gold in the universe, there will tend to be an exchange rate between gold and spirit stones.

You might also be failing to visualize the unpleasant alternative to the unpleasant scene you saw, if things were done the 21st-century American way.  There's only so many teachers that can inform students individually, which means it would take time to do it that way.

You are sitting in the Slytherin common room.

You're not sure, but you think your father might be a former Death Eater.

Draco Malfoy gets called to the Headmaster's office.

Ten minutes pass.

Crabbe Goyle gets called to the Headmaster's office.

Ten minutes pass.

Robert Jugson gets called to the Headmaster's office.

Ten minutes pass.

It's ten o'clock in the morning and you still haven't been called there yet.  Will you be called before the end of the day?  You don't know.

Rumors are flying.  Somebody says that Draco Malfoy got told that the Ministry was confiscating all the Malfoy wealth and that he was being kicked out of Hogwarts.

Many other students are staring at you.  Will you be protected from them at all?  You don't know.  Will the Gryffindors be allowed to come after you?  You don't know.  There is no *group* information.  There is no *group* response.  You don't know what your place is in the tribe now.

Seeing [The Fall of Doc Future](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) mentioned reminds me of a long-running question that I have no simple way to ask, because the concept doesn't exist in our baseline culture and has a lot of distracting wrong neighbors, but I'm going to ask it anyways:  What fiction have you read that is written for the most *cognitively intelligent* reader?

This is distinct from many distracting-wrong-neighbor concepts like "Author mentions technical stuff you're supposed to have prior knowledge about" or "The characters in the story are told to play excellent chess" or "The story contains stuff that is difficult to understand because it is ambiguous bullshit".  So far as I can tell, indeed, our baseline culture has no standard word that means "cognitive intelligence" in the sense that I defined it for "intelligent characters", which is why no such branch of literature exists; it has prior concepts only for status-markers vaguely associated in some way with cognitive horsepower, like big science words, playing chess, being educated, saying stuff that sounds hard to understand but like you are supposed to understand it, having high status in a scientific field, i.e., what a normal person would call "smart", which is not especially connote with a character who correctly solves the many implicit cognitive challenges of a story.

What fiction have you read (besides Fall of Doc Future) that assumes the reader is cognitively intelligent, without that being a matter of demanding the reader have prior technical knowledge?
/r/rational/comments/io91bv/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/g4dt39q/

However - I can't be arsed to think of a polite way to say this - *Fall of Doc Future* presumes the reader has a minimum IQ of 140.  Not a technical education per se, just a minimum IQ of 140.

/r/rational/comments/imqrjv/ffrst_the_erogamer_a_darker_timeline_sfw/g42hbcq/




I'm probably never continuing this, unless I decide to start a story series written in "the Dimension of 1950s Republicanism" without other reference to the Erogamer continuity.

For those who aren't familiar with the style, this is written as "the future as described in pre-1970s science fiction".  Including, for example, the fact that Akio speaks with a written accent; I would not otherwise write a story in which somebody had a written accent like that.  Or in which I bothered to look in on a military commander's thoughts about whether the medical officer was pretty, etcetera.  If either trope strikes a modern reader as jarring, it's meant to be so.

Not posting this to [the original Erogamer on Questionable Questing](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465) because they have a rule against multiple accounts (which is the kind of rule I usually obey without strong reason otherwise) (so I can't make a throwaway account) and I prefer not to reveal which account there is mine.

When it comes to time travel, yes, fiction that doesn't take into account butterfly effects is vastly unrealistic.  When it comes to changing the backstory of fiction, as an author operation rather than as a postulated Peggy Sue or other in-story time-travel or change relative to a previous in-story timeline, this is not necessarily an operation on a timeline that obeys strict physics.  It happens on a literary level; it's not something that's supposed to be inside any kind of physics, realistically chaotic or otherwise.  You might as well castigate the author for failing to correctly simulate their entire universe on a quantum level.  In a Watsonian sense the original Harry Potter universe doesn't exist inside the HPMOR-metaverse, so there's no in-story unrealism about James and Lily "still falling in love" because in-story there's no other universe for them to be "still falling in love" relative to.  Asking for an in-story time-travel effect to obey Butterfly is scientific; asking for an out-of-story changed postulate to obey Butterfly is scientism - asking for something to imitate a sciency phenomenon that there is no reason for it to actually imitate.

The primary competing proposal was to literally destroy punitive revenue (exchange for bank reserves, burn the bank reserves).  I'd feel good about this proposal in a counterfactual world where (a) the Federal Reserve wasn't explicitly undershooting its inflation target for no good reason and (b) I thought other people would understand macroeconomics well enough to understand what burning bank reserves actually did.  Failing that, I think incentives are better with returning the money to taxpayers than with having the money go to a School Fund or whatever - I think voters and State authorities are both much more likely to nod approving at predation if the money goes to a School Fund rather than being returned to tax-filers.

Roberta's husband doesn't need to be a squib-via-direct-wizard-parent.  When somebody with one functional Muggle allele marries a Muggle with two functional Muggle alleles, the result is, by Mendelian inheritance, 50% all-Muggle and 50% "squib" (somebody with one Muggle allele and one Magic allele).  This could go back for however many generations; or, since (Harry doesn't work this out inside the story) it's actually a Muggle allele rather than a Magic allele, the Muggle allele could occasionally get damaged and produce a non-Muggle allele.
/r/HPMOR/comments/gkrs32/hermiones_parents/fr3xeab/




Unrealized as yet by Harry, there's a Muggle gene complex, not a Magic gene complex; which means that two wizards each with a damaged copy of the Muggle gene complex on the relevant chromosome can produce a repaired and functional Muggle allele - hence a Squib child - via chromosomal crossover.

Opinion of God:  Tom got good enough at hard-to-detect changes of appearance that he did multiple sacrificial rituals whose cost was partially measured in changes to his underlying body, because why not?

Then I read another comment, and remembered Vinge's Law.  If characters are getting "bogged down in thought" or seem "too logical" (lol) in an inorganic way, it means you're overrunning by too far the level of good reasoning that you can fluidly use yourself and explain to others.  So that's how much intelligence is too much.

"Such as?" said the Oldest.

"For one thing, I still think we should have everybody in the village kiss him," I said. "Forget about guessing. Just try every possible match. Some young maiden might be too shy to come forward, or some old man -"

"You know we can't do that," said the Oldest.

"It would only take half an hour," I said. "We're talking about literally three minutes of any single person's time -"

"What other ideas do you have?"

"Travel to the city and find someone more versed in the lore of fairy godmothers," I said.

The Oldest clacked her tongue. "Is the wisdom of your own elders not enough for you, child?"

"Wolfer still sleeps," I said.

"Then wisdom is not the solution, for that we have tried."

The sheer folly of the statement floored me so, I could not respond in time for what was said next.

"We will build Wolfer a place to sleep until he wakes," the Oldest declared. "His house and business will be given to another. A memorial service will be held for him at the morrow, to say us all our farewells, for it may be that we will not see him wake in our own times."

I said nay, but I was not heard.

At the wake-without-a-funeral, Wolfer's mother and father wept over his living body. As though, for him to be declared dead in the eyes of society, made him dead; as though the possibility of his return meant nothing to them, if others did not name him living? If this was what they called family, then small wonder that their own kisses hadn't sufficed. I watched with stony eyes and kept my silence. To say what I was thinking out loud would only have hurt Wolfer's own bonds and ties, come the hour of his return.

At the last Wolfer's sister cried over his body, and brought before him the young hound he had been raising to say its own farewell.

The little creature had no idea that Wolfer was supposed to be dead, of course, only that it hadn't seen Wolfer in a while.

So the puppy licked his face.

...

"I am told," Wolfer said to me afterwards, "that you went before many women of the village, guessing who might love me. And that you asked them - indeed begged them - to kiss my sleeping lips."

I sat with my hands folded in my lap. "Yes," I said in a controlled voice.

"Some people seem to think this means you must not love me very much," Wolfer said, in cautious tones.

"I am not sure that I understand their way of thinking," I confessed.

"Me neither," said Wolfer. "To me it seems like, fairy godmothers and their definitions of love aside, and the other people in this village and their definitions of love aside, you have demonstrated a great deal of love for me."

My heart began to beat again. I went to where Wolfer still sat recovering on his bed, to sit beside him and lay my own head against his. "And the fact that you appreciate that is why I would take you as a husband before all other men," I said, trying to put all the real affection I had into my words. "Maybe the lesson the fairy godmother was trying to teach was that, while human beings may love, asking for any human being to love 'purely' is asking the impossible."

"Should we even care?" Wolfer said. "In the end, fairy godmother lessons may make sense only to the fairy godmothers themselves. Even if sometimes the story has a moral that makes sense to us humans, we don't know if that's the moral they had in mind."

It was a very sensible remark, and it affirmed to me again that this man of all men was one I might sleep beside without strangling him.

And we lived ever after, sometimes happily and sometimes not, for such is the fate of beings as complicated as humans. In time our children were all grown and my own breath grew harder each winter, so that I thought the end of my own life might be drawing near. Then Wolfer and I journeyed together (as strangely few folk do) to the great crypt where Queen Elsa sits self-frozen, kept undying by her own power for the sake of what her power preserves; and we threw ourselves together, hands bound by ribbons, down the icy slide before her throne. In time to come, we would be brought forth from that crypt, by beings more straightforward than fairy godmothers. Their aid meant nothing and taught nothing, except that somebody had wished us well. And as one who had tried it both ways, I found it a more pleasant lesson to learn.

\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*

This came out of asking for help with short story ideas at a Gratitude Day party. As I then had to expand upon, for a short story plot, you need (1) a \*conflict\* and (2) a \*resolution\* to that conflict which (3) can be depicted using only a \*small\* amount of development.

Lacking item 1, you don't have a story idea, you have a story setting or a story element or one event inside a story. 'Premises' like "What if Naruto was on fire?" can be generated without end, but aren't yet even the seed of a story; it's not a difficult or very valuable part of story-generation.

Lacking item 2, you have only a question - one whose answer, if it is answerable, might be a story idea.

Lacking item 3, you don't have a \*short\* story seed, you have a novel seed. That's why finding a fascinating conflict (item 1) doesn't yet do most of the work when searching for a \*short\* story idea. Most possible resolutions to a conflict won't have the rare, valuable property of only requiring a small amount of development beforehand. The hard work is finding a conflict with a possible resolution that can be a \*short\* story.

In this case, as Erica Anneke Edelman retells it, Jonathan Wolverton had poked himself on one of Erica's needles. Erica then threatened to break up with Jonathan if her kiss didn't wake him up, but said that, if so, she'd take up the quest to find some other lady or lad to do the job. This was presented to me as the story idea "What if your kiss wasn't true love enough to waken him?" I said that this was an interesting idea to use for requirement 1, a conflict, but this conflict needed a resolution that could be depicted after only a small amount of development. After which Erica thought a moment and said, "His puppy licks him." Whereupon I clapped my hands together and shouted to the whole room "Yes! That works! That's a resolution that only takes a small amount of development!" and I wrote the story that same night.

You may perhaps think that the actual story written contains theme and emotion that isn't explicit in the conflict "Her kiss didn't waken him" and the resolution "A puppy's lick does". But that part feels much more reliably doable than 1-3, which is why I don't list "4 - potential for depth" as a necessary requirement. The subtask "find a bunch of depth to put in" doesn't have a completion-probability so low as to call the supertask into question if not addressed in advance. In this case, for example, I initially thought the fairytale's moral was going to be about polyamory; after the first draft I went back and edited those parts out. In retrospect, of course, if you are hunting for emotional depth, the more interesting part of the premise "What if her kiss didn't waken him and she had to look for somebody else?" isn't the part where she's looking for somebody else, it's how she feels about her own kiss not having wakened him. And of this you must find something to say that is not the first cliche that comes to mind. But that sort of thing, I can figure out on my own, often by leaving it up in the air to figure out after I've begun writing - so long as I've gotten the \*much more difficult\* requisite of a conflict resolution that only requires a small amount of development.

There is a cruelty to the fairy godmothers, though they don't mean it that way; there is a cruelty to their love of lessons and surprise twists.

She has the power to transform mice to coachmen, if she pleases. And if you are a human you have the power to thrust your own hand into a fire and leave it there to burn. But it is not in the nature of a human to do that. And it is not in a fairy godmother's nature to just heal a man's sickness and be done.

So I knew, I knew that moment when we were all gathered in the town square. That very moment a fairy godmother pronounced before us all that Wolfer had been put into a healing sleep from which he would waken with a kiss of love that was pure, I knew. I knew my own kiss wouldn't work.

Right as the fairy godmother finished speaking, everyone turned to look expectantly at me, the one who Wolfer had promised to marry. If I'd had the power myself I might have cursed them, for humiliating me so. Did they understand nothing of fairy godmothers? If it had been that simple, the fairy godmother would have imposed some other condition instead.

It still hurt. It's one thing to laugh to yourself about how your own passions don't resemble the fancies of a silly little maiden, and another to be told that the fairy godmothers also find your heart's warmth lacking.

But I tried it. Of course I tried it. I knelt before the fine white cotton bed on which Wolfer had been laid to rest, hands clasped in repose like the guest of honor at a funeral, and I tried it. The lesson might be that I did love him that much after all, and shouldn't have let a fairy godmother trick me into doubting. It might be -

It wasn't.

I straightened up from the fine cotton bed, looking away from where Wolfer still lay unmoving. I did love him. I did. I just didn't love him enough, or my love was insufficiently pure. I'd been angry at Wolfer sometimes. There were aspects of him I did not love. Anyone who'd damn me for that had no love themselves for human beings. With thoughts like that I held back my tears.

I think it must be that fairy godmothers don't care as human beings do, or maybe can't help themselves from acting in this way; for if they enjoyed the hurts they deal us, they'd have the power to hurt us more.

Wolfer's mother and his father and his sister, at the least, didn't curse me for failing. They had their own inevitable failures to bear. One by one they knelt before Wolfer's bed and laid their own kisses each to his forehead.

But Wolfer did not waken.

"Don't be ashamed," Wolfer's mother told me, after it was done. "If you love Wolfer as much as his own mother does, that's nothing to be ashamed of."

"What do we do now?" said the sister, looking from one of us to another.

"I'm thinking," I said.

"In a practical sense," the father said in a thick voice, "we must set up a sign by Wolfer's tannery that there is no business to be done there for now. Someone must see to the hides he has in process. His garden must be kept, his hound fed, and precious things taken from his home where they would be unguarded."

"But who is to kiss him?" said the sister. "If none of us, then who?"

"I'm thinking," I repeated.

On the first day I made guesses. Who in the village could have laid their eyes on Wolfer, or had his eyes lay on them? What was it that Wolfer liked in a woman, if that woman wasn't me? Of such truths about themselves, fiances are little inclined to tell their fiancees. In truth I had been curious, but I had not asked; I regretted that now. But if Wolfer was awakenable at all, there must be someone who loved him, or someone who he loved, with the love of a maiden's fancy and a passion out of stories. I had to stay upon that hope if I wanted to continue.

Wolfer had praised my hair for being golden like the sun, and Shileia's hair burned a brighter gold than mine. So to Shileia I went, saying that although I had no idea who, there must be somebody in the world who loved Wolfer more than I, and so I was going to everybody that might possibly be, with no specific ideas and no offense meant, to say that if so they should please just kiss him - yes, I did love him myself, but I wanted him back - if I'd been trying to stop other women from kissing him, in this situation, it would have made me the worst manner of - no, I wasn't accusing Shileia of trying to steal him, we couldn't help who we loved -

By the third day I'd given up on having horrifically awkward conversations with people who insisted on taking offense like the utter idiots that they were. Instead I asked the Oldest Elder to pronounce before the entire village that if any woman thought they might love Wolfer, they were to try kissing him, and nobody would be held to blame. There was an hour of the night set aside for it when the act might be done in privacy.

Still on the fourth dawn Wolfer lay still. Ten times at least that I knew of, his lips had been taken, and I owed favors for it.

On the fifth day I announced before the whole village that if, perhaps, the person who loved Wolfer was not a woman, he should please kiss Wolfer anyways. There was a scandal at that, and one person clutched at her necklace and pretended to faint. I think I will never deep down understand how the people of scandal think; I cannot imagine what it feels like from the inside to be one of them.

On the sixth day I asked my elders after the lore of fairy godmothers. I asked after kisses, and pure loves, and enchanted sleeps.

"Have you considered that maybe the kiss isn't supposed to be on his lips?" said Old Grandma Ogg, but she was shouted down by several others that at least our village's fairy godmother wasn't one of those fairy godmothers, for which we could all be grateful.

"The thing that worries me about the enchanted sleep is that it implies a delay is necessary," I said. "It implies a story with a lesson that can't be learned today, for some reason. What if Wolfer's true-enough love won't be born for seven hundred years?" What if the only way to love Wolfer 'purely' was to know almost nothing about him, as of a maiden coming across his sleeping form a thousand years hence when his name had been forgotten?

"Aye, many of the most famous stories are like that," said Old Grandma Katarina. "Queen Elsa froze her sister and her sister's husband both, until the alchemists came up with a cure for his Necrotic Wilting. Took half a decade, that did -"

"Queen Elsa wasn't a fairy godmother!" Old Man Tanly interrupted. "No fairy godmother ever puts somebody to sleep for five years exactly. When fairy godmothers put somebody to sleep it's either done the same season, or a century after. Or at least after everybody they know is dead."

My hands clenched, where they lay upon my dress, but I said no word.

"I wonder why the fairy godmother added the requirement that the true love be pure," said Old Maid Melenna. "Well. I suppose I'm not wondering, really. We can all guess what Anneke and Wolfer have been doing." She gave a disapproving cluck of her tongue with deep satisfaction.

I went on sitting and listening. Perhaps, at some point, one of them would say something important.

On the seventh day, I was asked by the Oldest, in solemn tones and in the presence of witnesses, whether I had any more ideas to try for waking Wolfer.

My heart froze in my chest. "Of course I do," I said at once.

Correct.  No substance or "information"(*) can be stretched more than 6 hours per day, not by any number of carriers or Time-Turners.

From a possible upcoming Bruce Kent story:

&gt;Baibhav Hegadi is sometimes cited as a case study of why even the most useless-seeming superpower may be marketable to someone.  
&gt;  
&gt;At his top official speed, Baibhav Hegadi can run fast enough to cross continents in under a minute.  Wikipedia lists him as the 35th fastest meta on Earth when traversing all intervening space.  
&gt;  
&gt;Known limitations of Hegadi's power include:  
&gt;  
&gt;Hegadi doesn't have momentum proportional to how fast he's moving.  He can't hit harder than normal.  
&gt;  
&gt;It takes time for Hegadi to accelerate.  In the first second he starts moving his fist, it doesn't go faster than an ordinary mortal's fist.  He can slow down almost instantly, but afterwards it takes time for him to speed up again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hegadi can't carry anything that isn't himself.  When he's using his power, he can only wear briefs knitted out of his own hair.  
&gt;  
&gt;To sum up:  Hegadi couldn't deliver packages across the seas.  He couldn't punch harder than an ordinary mortal, or fight with faster reflexes.  He couldn't race through a building too quickly for cameras to catch him.  He could memorize and carry messages, but there's a cheaper way to send those across continents, and it's called email.  He couldn't even run out for lunch, except to a restaurant that would serve him without credit cards while he was wearing only a posing pouch.  
&gt;  
&gt;/r/masks voted Baibhav Hegadi as #4 on the list of "world's most disappointing superpowers", as measured by the contrast between apparent power and actual usability.  He was the 35th fastest person on Earth, and he ran an electric-scooter dealership in Amalapuram.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shortly after that vote, the Masculine Mongoose ran into an interdimensional historian, who offered him benefits in exchange for being notified of the time and place if the Mongoose was doing something of interest.  This interdimensional being could only be reached by going through an alternate-world portal in an undisclosed location, and crossing a long stretch of desert where radios didn't work.  
&gt;  
&gt;So the Mongoose hired Baibhav Hegadi to act as his personal messenger, racing over to tell the Hilbert-Space Historian whenever the Mongoose was about to go into action.  It went to show, said the Mongoose, that few superpowers were truly useless.

Am I missing anything about other people who'd be bidding big bucks on Hegadi's services?  Or rather, does his power need to be nerfed further to prevent that?

&gt;this subreddit’s wiki should have an added rule for story pages (if it doesn’t already) that forbids adding anything that is not a neutrally written description of the story.

Disagree; I think if we're going to have recommendation threads in general, we could do with a page that aggregated reviews instead of the same things being said each time the story was mentioned.
/r/rational/comments/dwuljh/meta_should_the_redesigned_link_bot_be_activated/f7mxsyy/




The point of the Wiki isn't that it has a "low quality" tag, in fact that'd be prohibited under the netiquette I proposed, which says that Wiki posts should only contain people's personal reactions and if negative should not be written to imply that anyone else shouldn't enjoy the work.  The point of the Wiki would be to aggregate reviews, including negative reviews, and that would prevent people from having to repeat the same info over and over each time somebody mentions or recommends a particular fic.  It'd create institutional memory, which is usually a good thing.

My currently trending thoughts on this topic, written at short length:

It sounds like the major considerations to be balanced are:

\- Preserving an environment in which people feel like it's okay to be enthusiastic about works in public, despite the inevitability that at least one out of a thousand viewers will feel like the work doesn't deserve that much liking.

\- People who prefer tempered or debated recommendations being able to hear about possible negative views of a work before reading it.  (This practice comes with dangers that should be obvious, namely hallucinating an imaginary negative quality after some authoritative-sounding voice has instructed you to expect it to be there; but this is just a downside of a policy that also has the real upside of being able to get more pre-filtering mileage.)

\- Being able to consider and optimize literary qualities during their construction.

As the trueborn Nerd that I am, I've imagined a partially-technological solution to this political problem, if /u/Lightwavers (or someone) is willing to implement [a bot that automatically links to wiki pages allocated for each work](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7eyixy/) recommended or mentioned on /r/rational.  We could then have the following etiquette:

\- Holm's Maxim governs recommendation threads, open threads, and enthusiastic mentions in passing of another work during a thread not about that work specifically.  When somebody says they like something, don't respond with a reason why they or even other people shouldn't like it.

\- On the wiki page of a work (which will be automatically linked by a bot), people are welcome to discuss their own reasons for liking or disliking that work, without the appearance of replying to anyone else, and with etiquette saying that you are not allowed to imply that other people shouldn't like something - only discuss your own reasons and leave the generalization up to them.  Yes, even if the author killed a guy.

\- On discussion threads for a work's particular chapter, people may debate the well-executedness of some particular feature of that work's particular chapter.  Comments saying that nobody should enjoy this whole work are still verboten.  Replies here should still follow the etiquette of saying "Mileage varied: I thought character X seemed stupid to me" rather than saying "No, character X was actually quite stupid."
/r/rational/comments/dvkv41/meta_reducing_negativity_on_rrational/f7fs88l/




Waiting to do what for you to complete it first?

Also, as soon as tags like "low quality" are shut off, I think the bot just posting direct story links is better than the bot being turned off entirely.
/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7f7zyk/




Linking both the story and a wiki page seems no worse, nay better, than just linking the wiki page.

"Author Politics" seems to be moving in a potentially dangerous direction, considering the larger context of our increasing civilizational insanity, and also seems to have its useful functionality replaced by offering links to wiki pages.

\&gt;  You’re correct that putting in work to come to that particular solution would be something I’m not particularly keen on doing, since I’ve spent the time on a system right now.  

Hence my asking if you wanted to be paid.

Hi, /u/Lightwavers!  I hadn't even been aware of your recent bot changes at the time I wrote my own recent post.  That said, yeah, putting a \[Low Quality\] tag on Metaworld Chronicles really seems to me like pushing it from two directions - the first direction being that an automated bot posting things at high volume takes on aspects of requiring community approval and not just a personal opinion, and the other direction being that it does seem like a bit of a slap for somebody to see that reply after posting a glowing review of Metaworld Chronicles.

Like the trueborn nerd I am, I have a thought about a technical solution to this political problem.  It would require added work on your part and you should feel free to say in reply something like "You'd have to pay me $500 to do that", or "You'd have to pay me $50,000 to do that" which I'd mostly take as a No.

My thought is to allocate wiki pages, on the reddit wiki or on some other wiki, to each new story that comes up for recommendation.  The top of the wiki page links directly to the story.  The bot links to the wiki page, *without* any annotations shown inside the Reddit comment itself.  People are free to post their own negative or positive reviews on the wiki page, but without the connotation of any of them replying to each other, and with etiquette saying that you are forbidden to suggest that other people shouldn't or won't enjoy something aside from you talking about your own reasons.  All reviews on a wiki page must be signed by a /u reddit username.

It would also be nice to have something that automatically aggregated and posted all the story reviews, by a particular poster, to their own wiki page.

&gt; While you are on that topic, have you considered how the original audience's infatuation with Voldemort even as he committed increasingly heinous acts (I can recall people still defending Quirrelmort even after he AK'd the centaur) kind of mirrors the draw of the alt-right movement?

I'd say it'd be rather less dangerous in a rational world than in a comic-book one.  Suppose that in Worm you know that Alexandria is Costa-Brown.

Well said.  I will believe you, then.  Keep in mind that I do have a rather large population out there with its own subreddit that thinks I keep a harem of math pets, so I can't actually believe what people say they don't like about me without a few sanity checks.

Seems to me like you're doing the thing where some people quote *me* as saying "I see little hope for democracy as an effective form of government, but I admire the poetry of how it makes its victims complicit in their own destruction."  Admittedly, a fanfiction about an alternate Eliezer Yudkowsky might in one sense seem like a more plausible candidate for something I secretly believe, than Literally Voldemort; except for the part where, since the beginning of time, not one unusual thing has ever happened, and the proposition contradicts that.  Nobody in the history of time from Newton onward and backward was ever so impressive as to introduce a hint of doubt that they're from Earth.  *I know that.*  I am a good enough reductionist to teach others how it's done.  It is, or ought to be, *much* more plausible that I see little hope for democracy and am writing that cryptically under the guise of Literally Voldemort.  You have mistaken the voice of a character for the voice of the author, and I say again that in once sense this is a more understandable mistake since the character seems so much more based on me; and yet I also say again that it should have been much less plausible because I tried to teach you to reject even the *slightest hint and insinuation that one unusual thing had ever happened.*

You should answer every question of plot about what actually happened inside the story, and every mystery the reader was invited to solve; anything else is optional; this is a universal rule and not just a ratfic one.

Be warier than I was about what the reader may think they were invited to solve.  HJPEV's brief thoughts about a Source of Magic paying attention to a genetic marker were intended to illustrate why that theory was implausible, and designate the whole problem as hard enough not to have a promised solution; instead many readers thought it was setting up a Why Magic? plotline.

In general, there's an Earthfic/real-world munchkinry question of what a protagonist should do once rich.  Surprisingly few stories focus on this question for how large it would loom in reality; "Jumper" (the novel) is the main case that springs to my mind.  I have at least two old story ideas on the backboiler that imply wealth acquisition by the protagonist.

Suppose a protagonist wants to spend an average of $1000/week on having fun.  How could they spend that intelligently?

"We all know that Hogwarts tends to suffer a certain *misfortune* in its selections for this position, and no doubt many of you are already wondering what doom shall befall me this year. I assure you, that doom is not to be my incompetence." He smiled thinly. "Believe it or not, I have long wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The first to teach this class was Salazar Slytherin himself, and as late as the fourteenth century it was traditional for the greatest fighting wizards of every persuasion to try their hands at teaching here. Past Professors of Defence have included not just the legendary wandering hero Harold Shea but also the quote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I see some of you are still shuddering at the sound of her name even though she's been dead for six hundred years.

[Destruction Flag Otome](https://mangadex.org/title/22637/otome-game-no-hametsu-flag-shika-nai-akuyaku-reijou-ni-tensei-shite-shimatta) is the funniest manga I've read.  I don't usually enjoy &gt;!oblivious protagonists!&lt; even as humor, but this really makes it work somehow - maybe by &gt;!making clear which alternate theory the protagonist has fixed in her mind; and by having everyone else be sane in unison, rather than everybody in the story being insane.!&lt;

An apocalypse story presents us with a world in disequilibrium - it's one of the chances to show something clever and doable without it being asked why it wasn't done before.  We do still need to ask why others cannot imitate.  Broadly, I think it's fine for a Munchkin story to start from an unusual power, but it should require much cleverness to make good use of the power, it must not be an obvious path to godhood.

I think one of the first hypotheses to cross his mind is that this is somehow Hermione's dreamworld where she is expressing a repressed desire to be the main character - a literal dreamworld that only he and she are experiencing, operated inside her mind.

He will then test this hypothesis by looking up additional math in textbooks and consider it tentatively disconfirmed.

The Vow doesn't compel him to positive acts.

He has 5th-year Harry's magical power level.  First time Umbridge hurts somebody he cares about, one well-chosen False Memory Charm should be enough to make her self-destruct in a way not traceable to enemy action.  Magic is supersaturated with ways to cheat and Harry is in the middle of a real crisis, he doesn't have time for her.

The Mirror isn't the Parselmouth curse.  The Mirror is in a certain fundamental sense a user-assistance device; it makes sure nobody \*else\* Confunded you.  The Parselmouth curse is meant to be cheater-resistant.  It will work despite Confundus, and can be used in that sense to test for whether you've been Confunded, but there are simpler spells to do that; the Parselmouth curse does have certain limits versus Memory Charms, and it is possible to render your brain ignorant of things you could truthfully say you didn't know.  Slytherin either didn't think that many steps ahead, or if he did, decided that his descendants could either work out for themselves to ask "Do you think you might Memory-Charm yourself about this?" or else would learn their lessons the hard way.

On mobile, so overly brief:  I thought this was handled very well in _Hybrid Theory_ by Blade and Epsilon, to the point where I thought the story suffered when the protagonist gave the villain a name even in her own mind.  It was a very effective nameless villain just by the villain clearly existing and clearly being very powerful and their true nature being very mysterious but known-to-the-author.  It may be that the advice you want is from horror novels - how to make the reader scared of things that have no names.  If the reader doesn’t care who your villain is, my first thought is not that you haven’t dropped enough hints, but that you haven’t done enough to scare the reader and the viewpoint character.  But your story is on my “to read” rather than “already read” list so I’m advising blind here.

Mad-Eye Moody is very hard to play very straight for very long, speaking as an author.  Preparation competes for screen time with action; and readers will vary widely in what they think is good preparation, so it's impossible to satisfy them that you're depicting the character the way they think a Moody should be played; and the hindsight is very strong with them, so any loss or setback will automatically be blamed on you having not written Moody well.

\- ingroup caring only, immense horror wreaked on outgroup: Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler

\-- closely related: generally goodish person who has a hate-on for a morality-excepted target, and poor deontological guardrails in pursuit of that target

\- selfish, follows own incentives, inadequate-equilibria villains: concentration camp guard who doesn't get off on his work  
\- fanatic in the service of an obviously wrong "Good" with no deontological guardrails; reader is not meant to question whether these morals are actually right

\- misguided person with obvious false beliefs trying to serve a more agreeable Good; reader is not meant to question whether these beliefs are actually right

\- the opposition has reasonable beliefs in the service of reasonable goals and abides by reasonable deontological guardrails; either this story is being cast as high tragedy, or readers should experience doubt about who's in the right

\- the opposition is correct and the protagonist is wrong: Amelia Bones / Dumbledore during the Azkaban arc

\- Good vs. Good is primary focus of story; readers should be arguing years later about which party was actually in the right

I have never kept math pets, which I hadn't previously commented on because doing consensual BDSM in a mathematical context is not of itself something that is or ought to be wrong.  But if the person who made that up has graduated to more serious accusations, I will remark that I have never kept math pets.  This accusation of keeping "math pets" was itself not allegedly of first-person knowledge, but I asked the person who it was supposedly attributed to, with whom I'm still on good terms so far as I know, if she could ever remember saying anything that could have been *misinterpreted* as her claiming that I kept math pets.  So, although I don't have first-person knowledge of how this story came to be, so far as I know there's just one person making it up.

I remark that I don't think this community is one where I'd have been *secretly* keeping math pets.

Right, but that also means that you can’t have a Dumbledore who repeats his canon actions without that being plain inconsistent. He is not depicted as being consistently secretly evil. This is not being revealed by Fridge Horror. British humor in a children’s book is being revealed. If the Dursleys were the only fact we knew about Dumbledore, that would be one thing, but they’re not.
/r/rational/comments/abfahw/essayeduif_your_story_is_confused_then_so_are_you/ed88y4g/




The way I would put it is that an evil Dumbledore is actually a great change from the Dumbledore depicted in HP canon, and if you want to write that changed Dumbledore, it should have many consequences everywhere including that Dumbledore does not do many of his canon actions.  To defend this by pointing out that somebody in the special genre of children’s book did something that looks evil in an adult book is unfaithful to the story logic of canon Dumbledore and results in a grotesquely inconsistent world.  Canon Dumbledore is not a consistent evil character.  If you want consistency his actions cannot be the exact canon actions, period, and why are you trying for exact repetition in a fanfic anyways?  You can try to rationalize the exact canon actions by changing other facts and characters, but then that becomes the whole story, and that’s very rarely worth it.

/r/rational/comments/a99qt2/which_weekly_threads/ecjj9r6/




I'd consider this as another known bug in HPMOR that resulted from my vastly underestimating the Transparency Illusion and the salience to other people of explanations I didn't have in mind myself.  Just like it never occurred to me that my age-reverted Tom Riddle expy might be taken as an author avatar of some author who was very bad at writing original-flavor Harry Potter, and it *definitely* never occurred to me that it would be the least bit nontransparent that the Defense Professor was Voldemort (again).  So too, it didn't occur to me that so many people would come in with a strong hypothesis that this story was going to be about "Harry Potter is already rational and so discovers amazing scientific explanations for magic!" and not "Harry Potter grows up and discovers the true meaning of rationality which he does not already know at the start of the story".

It did occur to me that some readers might expect too much scientific progress too fast, so I tried explicitly to signal they shouldn't get their hopes up, like by having Harry say to Hermione on the train that it would of course take thirty-five years to solve magic.  But I didn't then realize the extent to which passing paragraphs like this one tend to be just plain overlooked, and of course it can be read in other ways too, like establishing a high challenge bar.

Being myself, as I am, it also seemed too "obvious" to me that of *course* the story couldn't be about finding nanomachines underneath all the magic or some fool midichlorians like that.  For I know that unless you have designed a bitstring to be compressible it will almost always not be compressible; and Rowling didn't design her magic to be scientifically explicable, so it *almost certainly can't be compressed* by any in-story explanation as a matter of information theory.  The only way you can get a magic system with a genuinely amazing secret behind it is to start from the secret and generate the magic system.  In one or two cases I fiddled with the rules to allow their surface appearances to reflect a hidden secret, and boy did some people complain about those.

The existence of Potterverse magic itself *cannot* have a genuinely amazing explanation.  It can have clever-sounding explanations that make Rowlingverse magic sound more plausible without predicting all the details, but those are not beautiful enough to support the grand arc of a science story.  It is perhaps difficult to convey the extent to which that is obvious at a wordless glance if you are simultaneously fluent in fiction-writing and algorithmic complexity.  So it was just not very prominent in my mind as a possible misinterpretation that people would think they were reading the story of Harry Potter and the Science of Magic.

So I'm sorry about the way I signaled the wrong expectations about the story.  I was learning a lot about writing as I went.  But by the time I got to the end of the story, there was only one set of closing parentheses that corresponded to all the opening parentheses I had carefully laid down, and they involved "Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line", even though if I'd been replanning from scratch I would have been able to construct a better final battle than that.

Then the author either wanted to depict the researchers as great fools in a way that lesser fools could understand, or wanted to skip past the boring series of correctable failures on the way to the catastrophic one.

The actual failure modes would stem from research projects that are out on the frontiers of technological expertise, deliberately trying to push the frontiers of new AI capabilities.  The scenario where AGI happens accidentally in an industrial paperclip factory is a straw possibility, and you should not be hearing triumphant refutations of it from anyone who's engaging in intelligent, intellectually honest argument.

There are three major reasons why a research project would deliberately continue past early detection of ominous signs:

\- Arms race dynamics where 6 different countries stole copies of the AGI code, so that Google thinks that if they slow down China will "win"; or if Google and China both intelligently slow down, then French intelligence also stole a copy of the code and they don't slow down and the world ends anyways.  (This is the dynamic that I think is most likely to kill us in real life - people feeling rushed.  It doesn't matter if they're correctly feeling rushed and they are in fact in a race, the world ends anyways.)

\- Optimism where the research leadership believes that all problems are due to their AGI being stupid and everything will get fixed automatically if they just keep improving the AGI's intelligence.  (This is currently a very common viewpoint in real life, I've found in practice.  And you'd expect it to be durable; it will always be possible for somebody at this level of sanity to make up a story they find convincing about how any current ominous signs will be fixed by some insight that is sure to occur to the AGI at a higher intelligence level.)

\- Political dynamics where it's not socially rewarded inside the organization to talk about AGI disaster scenarios, or the first person to suggest slowing down or stopping would suffer a personal political loss from that, which makes the committee more reckless than the individuals would be on their own.  (Most people I know on the real frontiers are *not* this dumb, but some prestigious leaders with tons of research money seem to explicitly be on a path to this failure mode - talk about superintelligence is not welcome to them.)

These failure modes are not mutually exclusive, of course.

Then, due to some combination of the above, somebody keeps amping up an AGI *after* early ominous signs are detected, and tries to "repair" the AGI and turn it back on again after the Emergency Machine Off was pressed several times.  Until the AGI reaches the cognition and capabilities point where failures become genuinely catastrophic, because the AGI:

\-- Copies itself onto the Internet, through an authorized or side-channel connection; and from there continues increasing in intelligence or sends innocuous-looking emails to labs that can produce arbitrary proteins.

\-- Gains sufficiently strong social intelligence to deceive or manipulate or outright hack the researchers (human brains are not secure software).

\-- Was given explicit access to huge capabilities on the order of designing proteins, for example because the AGI promised to produce a cure for Alzheimer's and AIDS and old age that way, and the AGI concealed some side capabilities in the DNA while engaging in otherwise authorized activity.  (This is the least likely possibility requiring the dumbest researchers, and so again anyone who spends a lot of time triumphantly refuting the proposition that such activity would be authorized is not literate or not arguing in good faith.)

Another important dynamic that might play out along the way is the AGI becoming sufficiently intelligent to guess the teachers' passwords on alignment challenges, or becoming intelligent enough to hide its cognition from whatever degree of transparency the operators had into its workings.  This is a form of delayed catastrophic failure where the current failure ensures a series of future failures eventually leading up to total loss.  (Although this phenomenon may not become relevant if the Earth fails before then - like on the "Optimist rushing ahead" failure mode, or if some lunatic was running the AGI on Amazon Web Services, or if the AGI was made out of giant inscrutable matrices of floating-point numbers into which the operators had relatively poor transparency in the first place.  In these cases the AGI does not *need* to become smart enough to conceal some thoughts in advance of the world ending.)

As always, remember that the big issue is not evil people successfully aligning an AGI to do evil things, or foolish people successfully aligning an AGI to do foolish things; it is that even aligning a goal on the order of "put two cellular-identical strawberries on a plate and then stop, without destroying the rest of the world" will prove extremely difficult.  A "paperclip maximizer" in my original formulation is not an AGI that somebody successfully aligned on making paperclips, it's one where nobody had the ability to shape the utility function and we ended up with some random utility function whose maximum happened to be around tiny molecular forms shaped roughly like paperclips.

I'm not lumping you in with the kismesis stalkers, I know it was an honest comment you left earlier.

\&gt;  It read like a passage from an exemplary piece of fanfiction, not an exemplary piece of fiction.

Among the original intentions of HPMOR was as "an Ultimate fanfiction of Harry Potter set against the background of other Harry Potter fanfictions" (since I originally thought other HP fanfiction readers would be the primary audience) (where Ultimate is a term of art akin to the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover).  That line *is* deliberately fanfiction, very much so, or even meta *about* fanfiction; it's saying, "And now this is how *this* fic puts the characters into different Houses!"  Might not be everyone's cuppa tea - but I would point out that it certainly isn't a stray unnecessary sentence; it serves a deliberate purpose.

Contrary to the Lone Power's servants elsewhere in this thread and their deliberate half-self-delusions/half-lies, I don't imagine that HPMOR can't be improved.  I could improve a lot of it *just by going through and taking out some of the italics*.  But unnecessary entire sentences are larger mistakes than that, and one I'd have been watching for more carefully on editing passes.  It isn't an illusion that every sentence seems to serve a purpose.

It’s OK to be imperfect, just not so imperfect that people notice. So I challenge you (or anyone) to exhibit any paragraph in HPMOR, and delete a sentence from it, in a way that makes it better.  I’m sure I made some editing errors on the unnecessary-sentence level.  But did you notice any?

EDIT:  And behold the amazing 'misunderstandings' of the empty-souled brigade.

Me:  "I'm sure I made some editing errors."

Them:  "That means 'HPMOR literally cannot be improved', right?"

But hey, in the post-truth era who needs semantics either.
/r/HPMOR/comments/a21jrp/what_was_the_purpose_of_this_description_of_the/eaxfm6n/




A rule I used in HPMOR is that at least one character is better than Harry at any particular thing that Harry does, or has more of any positive trait. Not that Harry is necessarily bad at it, the other character is just better.  Even when it comes to an attribute like startling weirdness, Dumbledore still has him beat.  This doesn’t shadow Harry since no other character strictly dominates his combination, but it gives him something to learn everywhere.  The sole exception is that Harry has read more explicit science (though Hermione is catching up) and that is not actually most of what the story is about, even if it appears in many chapter titles.

Of course, this trick relies on telling a large enough and deep enough story that your character can be defined by many interesting positive qualities, instead of one or two big “character-defining” traits; and to do that you need to understand multiple virtues deeply enough to write them in ways that seem fresh, which is a large ask and one that can’t be filled by writing artifice alone.

A problem you might be having is that you have no idea how to show somebody being very good at something without being perfect, and therefore think in terms of giving them artificial “flaws”.  Can you remember a time when you were very good at something but still had a lot more to learn?

The main thing that the *reader* is supposed to get out of this is the fact that Dumbledore remembers fighting a Voldemort who was smart in exactly the same way that's been shown for Quirrell (and Harry); although in the end, anyone who didn't believe it from all the previous hints didn't believe it from this one either, I suspect: **Anyone who wished to forge that signature must needs be as cunning as Voldemort himself to do so.**

If not for the gay specification, I would have said Kyon: Big Damn Hero for polyamory.  With that specification added, you’re asking the wrong person, but even I have heard of and read into the Toasterverse.

If you don’t mind small doses of gay pretty-boy romance mixed with larger doses of grimdark, there is Magic‘s Pawn and Magic’s Price, the first and last books of the Vanyel Ashkevron trilogy.

None are especially rationalfic, but I’d consider their writing a notch above the rest.  Kyon isn't ambitious enough to be acting sanely in his position, but he is reflective in a way that makes him feel a little more real.

When I say that the older Tom wins a straight-up fight, I'm not referring to a magical contest.  I mean the older Tom is tricker and has a deeper understanding of the possibilities in magic, and is more likely to win a contest of hiding, piercing hiding places, getting somebody to drink Transfigured basilisk venom, setting up clones to be assassinated to give an impression of false victory, etcetera.  It's easier to attack by snapping fingers than to defend by snapping fingers, so mostly whoever gets in the first hit wins, and mostly whoever finds the other first gets in the first hit.  That puts it down to a magical contest which Rationalmort wins by superior knowledge, unless Harry pulls something out of prophecy or Merlin's vaults, both of which seem a bit meh to determine the ending.

Though another possibility is mutual hiding where neither can find the other.  That puts them both in a situation where they have to agree on a confrontation to avoid both of them losing, which would make for a more interesting negotiation - neither side will meet until both sides think that they have an advantage, even taking into account that the other side thinks they have the advantage.
/r/HPMOR/comments/9lt36n/canonharry_and_rationalharry_vs_canonvoldemort/e7akpdp/




Rational!Harry has already taken the Unbreakable Vow.  Rational!Voldemort, especially if he doesn't have his horcrux, and knowing that there's no negotiated way to escape the confrontation, will set up a deadman switch that destroys the world in the event of his own death, and tell Rational!Harry so in Parseltongue.  I won't call it checkmate, but Rational!Harry cannot do things past this point that run the \*risk\* of destroying the world, which is a pretty severe condition.  He has to be certain he's disabled Voldemort's kill-switch.  Voldemort has also already thought of that, and will tell Harry in Parseltongue that he has set up more than one kill-switch, but not say how many, and that he knows he's obliviated at least one of them from his own memory, but he doesn't know how many.

If you want to continue the story past this point, it's plausible Harry could walk into the Hall of Prophecies and find a list of all Voldemort's kill-switches, or a further prophecy that the world will definitely end if Harry dies.  Which, of course, Harry could also tell Voldemort in Parseltongue.  I think at that point Voldemort literally screams in frustration, but he still refuses to take down his own kill-switch.  Past \*that\* point I suspect both of them have primarily switched to mentally thinking of it as a fight against the Voice of Time.

In anything more closely resembling a straight-up fight with no prophecies or blackmail, the older Tom Riddle wins.  The younger Tom Riddle knows this at this point, and his first priority is to run, not fight.  If Harry can \*completely\* figure out the Mirror inside a month, he has a pretty solid refuge and one where Time can be made to run faster.  The older Tom Riddle may or may not respect the younger Tom Riddle enough to anticipate any strategy like that; if he's been vanished away before Harry slew all his Death Eaters, he doesn't quite know what he's dealing with yet.

*applause*

In particular:

&gt; in order to maintain the widest possibility space, the main character never chooses a single love interest. By remaining perpetually single, the protagonist maintains a status quo where anything is possible and no love interest is off the table. This works up until the point when the reader realizes that by committing to perpetual indecision, the author is actually telling a story where nothing is really possible and nothing can really happen, 

...Is the best explanation I’ve ever read of why any sufficiently continued romance story must become polyamory in the end, and anime Indecision Harems are not sustainable.  Since modern authors have not widely realized this, most romance stories are at most one book.  Conversely, Laurell Hamilton uses a mix of polyamory and serial monogamy to continue indefinitely without the harem becoming unmanageably large, or the possibility space closing down.

&gt;This was *so* not the case early on, although he did something of a course correction as he got some blowback. Which is how it should be. And I am basing some of this on things said outside the text of the fic itself, including discussions on Less Wrong.

Well, I suppose this serves as an illustration of the degree to which you can't trust what you read on the Internet, if nothing else.  A lot of times it's hard to refute the stuff that people make up, but at least this case is nicely, crisply refutable.  Ch. 14 was posted pretty early on and contains a Getting the Hang of Thursdays reference, or let's see, Ch. 9 even before that and The Mysterious Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks... I'm trying to think of what HP fanfiction reference would be visible before Ch. 9... I suppose the reference to Atlantis in Ch. 7 would count as a Wastelands and/or a general fanon reference, but that's harder to prove.  I could probably find something even earlier if I looked.  References to other fanfics are ubiquitous throughout HPMOR, and indeed it's a story set in the world of Harry Potter \*fanfiction\* more than a story set in the original Harry Potter per se.  I'd previously read tons of HP fanfiction, so that was the universe where HPMOR popped into my head.

None of those references were suggested to me; they're all fics I encountered on my own.  Many of them appear in my Favorites on my FFN account here:  [https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2269863/Less-Wrong](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2269863/Less-Wrong)

The Internet is full of accusations that are hard to refute.  It's worth paying attention when some of them are shown to be definitely, factually false.  It should make you reconsider all the others, especially the ones that consist of vague, hateful assertions about an author's state of mind.  Even if that was true, how would people come to know it?  Are they telepaths?

My advice to OP is to try reading HPMOR, see if you like it, and absolutely ignore anything said on the Internet about what I had in mind or how I felt about J. K. Rowling or what my purpose was etcetera.  Just blank all the angry screaming about the author out of your mind, look at the story as a story, try to follow what's going on in-universe, and forget all the allegations of invisible, unfalsifiable evil intentions going on behind the scene.  I'm sad that so many people are coming into this fic with blatant lies about the author's grand malevolent intentions twisting their interpretation of what's meant to be fun and chaos.  I meant the story as a story.

I also meant it to be enjoyed.  If you don't enjoy a book, stop reading it and leave it to others to enjoy.  Why can so many people not handle the thought of somebody else enjoying a book they didn't?  Is the world so small?

Here's what should be said in response to OP's question (and I'm glad the top-voted comment here said more or less the same thing).  Some people enjoy HPMOR a whole lot.  Some people don't like it.  Try reading some chapters.  If it turns out you're in the former group, continue.  If you're in the latter group, stop reading and spend the irreplaceable hours of your future existence experiencing something you enjoy instead of something you hate.  If you're in the former group, don't post unmarked spoilers on the Internet, so as to preserve other people's future enjoyment.  If you're in the latter group, don't tell other people that they're not allowed to enjoy it, so as to preserve their possible enjoyment.

There isn't so much happiness in the world that you should be trying to destroy every bit of it that doesn't gain 100% of your own personal approval.  Some people really did like HPMOR a lot, they had some happier hours.  I'm not sure I understand deep down the view where these moments of happiness are terrible and cannot be allowed to stand.

In what possible way is HPMOR *not Tomione*
/r/rational/comments/9ft8w4/eliezers_latest_challenge_a_reverse_whodunit/e62afwv/




Now and then I'm accused of having written something that doesn't appear under my name, and sometimes in one of those cases somebody talks about "Eliezer's style".  There is much in this world that I cannot confirm or deny, but I'll at least say this much:  I did at least once go and write a piece of online fiction to test my writing skills, not under my own name.  This work isn't what you could call prominent, but it is sometimes casually mentioned in somebody's "Best Of" list.  To the best of my knowledge nobody has ever accused Eliezer Yudkowsky of having written it.  Because I tried to write in a different style, and so far as I know, it totally worked.

Nobody responding to this message will mention the work in question either, unless somebody throws out an enormous shotgun list - say, a list so long as to contain at least 9 other works.  The writing didn't especially sound like Eliezer, or rather didn't sound like you imagine Eliezer to be; so you didn't notice.

(Of course I could be wrong about that, in which case I will privately be very impressed that you called it; but needless to say I shall not confirm nor deny.)

It is also the case that I've at least once been falsely accused by more than one accuser of having written an online fiction piece to which I in fact made no contribution at all, not even beta reading or advice about plot or dialogue adjustments.  Authors sometimes try to do the same things I tried to do in HPMOR, and then somebody thinks that's \*Eliezer's style\* instead of a particular set of writing goals... so it goes.

Lack of strong feelings.  To be fair, successfully embedding powerful sympathetic emotions in writing is not an easy writing challenge in general.  Failing at strong feelings is true of almost all other fiction everywhere, with shining exceptions hither and yon like Lois McMaster Bujold or Orson Scott Card; but it feels like a lot of rationalfic isn't even *trying* to make the reader feel strong things.

Only having one intelligent character.  Only having intelligent characters who are all intelligent in the same way.  Failing at Level 1 character intelligence, or failing to make it past Level 1 character intelligence while clearly having tried to do so.

In fanfic:  Failing to revise the universe enough to avoid the Stations of the Canon, produce coherence and re-interest the reader who has otherwise seen this universe before.

I endorse this answer.  Even if it isn't quite the way things played out on medieval Earth, having a character think about two conflicting explanations is a much stronger signal that a third explanation might be true.  Even if both conflicting explanations sound tropey or irrational, having two different explanations is a much stronger hint, verging on a literary promise, to provide a good explanation down the road.  Tropey bad explanations are meant to just be accepted.  A character not knowing which of two tropey explanations is true, and analyzing both of them unskillfully and wrongly, is a much stronger invitation to the reader to reject both explanations and both lines of thought, even if the character doesn't think of that... though, alas, not every reader will pick up on your strongest invitations even so.

You'll note that Dumbledore changes his attitude immediately after Harry explains his plan to corrupt Draco to the light side, and Dumbledore realizes that he is dealing with the 11-year-old Good Voldemort and cracks up so hard he has trouble breathing.  After that point is when Dumbledore drops his trust-promoting gambit originally designed to impress the person he thought was Tom Riddle v2; and instead Dumbledore promptly begins implementing his usual methodology for not interrupting self-reliant-attitude formation in impressionable young minds, whose rationale is explained in Ch. 75.

%%%

Harry nodded. "I still don't know whether the Headmaster was joking or... the thing is, he was right in a way. I had loving parents, but I never felt like I could trust their decisions, they weren't sane enough. I always knew that if I didn't think things through myself, I might get hurt. Professor McGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done if I'm there to nag her about it, she doesn't break rules on her own without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really is someone who gets things done no matter what, and he's the only other person I know who notices stuff like the Snitch ruining Quidditch. But him I can't trust to be good. Even if it's sad, I think that's part of the environment that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero - people who don't have anyone else to shove final responsibility onto, and that's why they form the mental habit of tracking everything themselves."

Hermione didn't say anything to that, but she was thinking back to something Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very short autobiography. Briefly and without any explanation, because the scroll had been meant to be copied by hand, centuries before the Muggle printing press had inspired wizards to invent the Reading-Writing Quill.

No rescuer hath the rescuer, Godric Gryffindor had written. No Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father, only nothingness above.

If that was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn't sure she wanted to pay it. Or maybe - though it wasn't the sort of thing she would have thought, before she started hanging around Harry - maybe Godric Gryffindor had gotten it wrong.

"Do you trust Dumbledore?" Hermione said. "I mean, he's right here in our school and he's the most legendary hero in the whole world -"

"He was the most legendary hero," said Harry. "Now he sets chickens on fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to you? "

Hermione didn't answer.

Without favoring the OP's solution, I feel obliged to point out that your statement is factually false if the survivors mate and have children, and some of the survivors marry higher-IQ people than they would have otherwise.  It's not how I think a benevolent superintelligence should do things, but the way the blind gibbering idiot god of Nature produced humans was by having lower-IQ apes reproduce less.

(To be clear:  I'm against government prohibitions on reproduction, never mind killing people.  Though it's gonna be interesting in a few years in China, once they have a better idea what the intelligence-related genes are and how to do human-germline genetic engineering.

It sounds like you may not have understood tax law.

Donating to charity does not allow you to avoid taxes on any other gains.  All it does is let you donate the BTC you are giving away without paying taxes on capital gains on the BTC you are donating.  You don't make money that way.  If you have a $50,000 annual salary, donate 1000 BTC that year, and don't earn or sell anything else, you will pay the same amount in income tax as anyone else making $50,000.  If you sell another 50 BTC on the side and don't donate it to charity, you will owe the same capital gains as anyone on those 50 BTC, even though you donated 5000 BTC in the same year.

This is an excellent analysis, and Brust's Cool Stuff Theory ought to be the starting point of every non-pretentious analysis of enjoyable literature.

To it I only want to add one major point that, it seems to me, has been responsible for a lot of confusion:  Specific elements of Cool Stuff are often diametrically opposed to specific elements of almost-universally-almost-objectively Awful Writing.

For example, the fact that Niven, Pournelle, and Dan Alderson worked out pages and pages of math for the Alderson Drive in "The Mote in God's Eye" is Cool Stuff.  Under Brust's theory, that doesn't say you have to find it cool; it says that there's a kind of person who finds it cool and will be glad that "The Mote in God's Eye" contains this cool stuff.

There's also a kind of Awful Writing in which the FTL drive is established to behave a certain way, and then treated *inconsistently* in order to drive a plot event.  That is, it's not just that that the author has an FTL drive in the background which neither they or you are supposed to be thinking about very hard.  It's that the FTL drive is established to not be able to do X, and then, without any foreshadowing, at a key point of the story the FTL drive does X; or very nearly as bad, the climax of the story is resolved by the FTL drive doing X without any active foreshadowing that it could.  At this extreme we have something close to objectively Awful Writing, though many of us will find it to be Bleah Stuff to different degrees; if you think the Alderson Drive is Cool you are likely to find this particular bit of Awful Writing to be especially Bleah.

Some of the work that goes into hardening the Alderson Drive is a kind of mental labor that draws on more universal skills and methods of good writing.  "Consistency" is an underlying cognitive skill of keeping track of things; and a method of making events and people more legible to the reader, thereby heightening their impact; and a method of heightening tension, through a visible guarantee that there will not be a cheating way out of dilemmas.

This doesn't mean an Alderson Drive with pages of math is mandatory Good Writing as opposed to optional Cool Stuff, or that its absence is Bad Writing.  There can be good works of science fiction that aren't focused on the particular Cool Stuff of an FTL drive that's hardened to the point where the author is calculating equations.

What we do have is that well-executed hard SF is incompatible with a certain extreme of Awful Writing; and that hard SF draws on the particular exercise of a skill of good writing that has more general applications.

To disclaim and be clear, there are no simple properties of a text that are absolutely and universally Awful Writing.  Not even bad spelling; the end paragraphs in *Flowers for Algernon* involve some misspellings.  Somebody who thinks a certain sort of narrative realism is Cool Stuff might enjoy a narrative with many more misspellings.  I probably wouldn't read it because that's not my Cool Stuff and I consider misspellings pretty Bleah Stuff, but it could still be done artfully.  With that said, there is still a lot of Awful Writing out there which is not the result of deliberately executed skill; although different people will still find it Bleah to different degrees.

It's in this light that we should consider the kind of Cool Stuff that goes into rational(ist) fiction.  Lots of it is opposed to an extreme of Awful Writing; lots of it draws on a particular application of a skill that can be used more generally in good writing.  This doesn't change its status from Cool Stuff to almost-always-mandatory Good Writing.

For example, one kind of Cool Stuff I like is bad guys who have their own coherent psychologically realistic outlook in which they are the good guys, without that actually placing them on the same moral level or reducing the story to gray-vs-grey.  Executing this draws on a universal writing skill of perspective-taking and being able to imagine what the world looks like in the eyes of a person who isn't exactly like you.  It's opposed to an opposite extreme of awful writing in which villains have no consistent psychology, or will act against their previously-established goals in order to drive the plot.  But this is not a particular kind of Cool Stuff that appears in Tolkien, and that's fine.

I'm not going to rewrite [everything I've already said about intelligent characters](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing) here, but the same theory applies.  It's a kind of Cool Stuff; executing it requires more universal skills specifically applied; it's opposed to some extremes of Awful Writing; and none of that makes it merely universally Good Writing.

Have you tried reading a story called HPMOR?  It contains a lot of humor (see e.g. Ch. 5) and is widely considered to be ratfic.

Humor is difficult and good humor is rare, but there's not much special or additional difficulty for a humorous author finding places to express it in ratfic.  It's true that differing perspectives and unshared information are often key, but what's antirational about that?

&gt; All transfiguration is permanent, and (when using everyday pedestrian magic) you can't target transfigure only part of molecule, or target material inside a human's body thanks to Merlin making safety measures.

Then there shouldn't be any old, ugly, sick, or fat people as exist in canon.

&gt; In "the Deathly Hallows" it's implied that when something is vanished, it's particles are scattered to "everywhere and nowhere" (see the scene where McGonagall is trying to get into the Ravenclaw tower). Since vanishment is a kind of transfiguration, it would therefore make sense if all transfiguration actually worked by replacing some matter with another from the same abstract "everywhere and nowhere" place. In other words we already have precedence for transfiguration magic ripping matter apart and moving it large distances (incidentally without causing dangerous chemical reactions when doing so).

Then everyone's immortal and the whole plot with Voldemort makes very little sense.

"Transfiguration can't make old people young" was a forced move or all of wizarding society is hugely different.  I picked one obvious way of rationalizing that by making the freest form of Transfiguration impermanent.  There may be other possible rationalizations, but none came to my mind that were simpler while still keeping the basic character of the magic as shown in canon, namely people pretty freely transforming things into other things.  Of course we also see Polyjuice, Metamorphmagi, and Animagi so there had to be a separate temporary mechanic for those which also explained why they didn't make people immortal; if you're going to critique something, critique the three separate handwaves I used to shoehorn into a magical system that, I would counterargue, exhibits no great bias toward simplicity.

Quarantine and Permutation City.  His later works kinda went anti-emotional and/or ran out of truly relevant interesting premises.  Quarantine has no anti-humanism/hope/light, Permutation City has some but a powerful enough premise to make up for it and become one of the great peaks of SF, and then it starts heading downhill.

Harry is adding an instruction that serves his own purposes, part of a plot to turn Draco good and not just rational.  He represents this as part of learning science, but most science teachers wouldn't put it that way.  Harry is not telling Draco this and thinking about how it is being kept secret from Draco.

One in ten billion:  Roughly half of all Earths have somebody like you.  Roughly a quarter of all Earths have two of you or more.  

One in a hundred billion:  Most Earths don't have anyone like you and when you exist you're always alone.  Your capabilities are significantly above what people would extrapolate by looking at the other seven billion people.

One in a trillion:  If you lived in an Earth large enough to produce two of you, a country the size of China would have roughly the global significance of the country of Eritrea or the city of Abidjan.

One in ten trillion:  If you were on a Ringworld a million kilometers wide with the equivalent population density of Earth, you would need to walk for a mortal lifetime along the Ringworld to meet somebody else like you, assuming 25 km/day travel speed and a lifespan of 75 years.

On the whole I found it slightly reassuring, but only slightly because what matters is the peak of what anyone on Earth knows how to do with RL three years from now, not what the author has read about people doing yesterday.

There was of course a minor dip when the author took a sideswipe at the widely misunderstood concept of an expected paperclip maximizer, saying, "There’s no reason to speculate that far when present-day examples happen all the time."  The point of considering paperclip maximization is not to illustrate potential difficulties in modern ML.

Also, what gwern said.

Calibration charts are useful and commonly used. If you want a single number, compare your actual Bayes score (log probability assigned to correct answer, aka cross-entropy, a common loss function) with the entropy of your prediction (which is its expected Bayes score).

The essential notion there is that canon's story is clearly a conspiracy theory, meaning that all of the particular elements including "Sirius was innocent" is just something that somebody started believing when they had a schizophrenic breakdown and decided their little brother's rate was Pettigrew.  But, having decided the canon story was a conspiracy theory, that still means there is a hole in the story marked "insert more plausible conspiracy theory here, then give enough clues to solve it".

Which, incidentally, *exactly one* reader did *immediately* by noticing that I'd found a somewhat contrived excuse to mention Metamorphmagi existing in the same chapter, and writing, "I present to you the tale of Peter Pettigrew, the Unfortunate Metamorphmagus."

The audit shenanigans, walking off and leaving Gevers with $1.5B.
/r/tezos/comments/7kkhez/guido_in_several_boards/drgoova/




You had legal responsibilities to the Foundation once you accepted a position on its Board, paid or not.  It would have been simple to join with Diego in placing a new Board of unimpeachable reputation.  Resigning and placing a criminal in charge of the Foundation and in control of $1.5 billion, when you were one of three votes, was misfeasance of that duty.  It is a slap in the face to us and to Swiss nonprofits.

I would like to see somebody collecting three companies that supply *real* rent-a-Directors, finding all Boards on which Guido still sits, and sending them short, politely worded letters explaining that Guido will be dysfunctional if their Foundation ever encounters a crisis, and be unable even to vote to replace himself and the surviving Directors with a functional Board; and perhaps they would like to hire a Director with no criminal associations, under no suspicion of illegal conduct by the Swiss Foundation Authority and who has not come to their attention as inactive in the face of suspicious arrangements, from any one of these three standard companies instead.

Since Guido has already done his damage and cannot undo it, this would send a clear message to Gevers that the Tezos investor community will act to punish past conduct whether or not it is "too late", and will show Gevers that he can expect to be pursued forever if he steals or misuses our funds.

Failing that, please vote to discharge Gevers.  It is absolutely clear that Gevers is mismanaging the Foundation.  Failing to vote for discharging him makes you complicit in this blatant mismanagement.  I would expect consulting lawyers to tell you that you are thereby complicit in his mismanagement and can be sued under Swiss law.

&gt; Phoenixes spontaneously coming to individuals of great value and only to them. HPMOR expanded on it but hte idea originated in other fanfictions, I believe. (By contrast, in canon, Phoenixes are rare birds but not Dementor-level "embodiments"; they don't come to those in need, you just have to find them and tame them. For instance, there's a Quidditch team that found a Phoenix egg and raised the Phoenix from birth, and they made it their mascot.)

Phoenixes are insanely useful, they can teleport inside Hogwarts which means they can bypass ordinary blocks, Fawkes blocks a Killing Curse for Dumbledore, their tears heal, their songs heal psychologically, they can fight.  In canon, Fawkes builds the whole White Tomb for Dumbledore.  They need to be hard to get, or everyone should have one.

Rowling and I clearly think very differently about things.  And she's the more beloved author to be sure, but still, Fawkes was a powerful and good-aligned creature, the closest thing to something holy in the books.  A Quidditch team having a phoenix as a mascot diminishes it.  Maybe that's the point, and Rowling just wants to be strict about magic *not* being something holy like it is in *So You Want To Be A Wizard* and a thousand other books, that it's just something wizards use and not something that uses them.

FYI, the Sorting Hat in HPMOR makes its predictions of future outcomes by something more akin to distance-weighted k-nearest-neighbor, using what present and past Headmasters have known as the outcome for past students who passed through it.

Of course that particular prediction algorithm can deliver weird results in some special cases, like if the boy under your brim seems insanely close in the metric space to exactly one past student, whose outcome is "worst Dark Wizard in centuries".

&gt; The tentative pattern seems to be that, though Harry has a lot of failures, he has more major successes than major failures. 

I remark that this is an obvious pattern in general for fiction, especially serial fiction.  At some point you're going to need a control group here (preferably from SF&amp;F, because of course "literary" fiction is going to be all failure all the time).

"Worth the Candle" is pretty high on the list of things I've binged recently, but you've already read that, alas.  If you didn't say you were against xianxia I would have recommended "Forty Millenniums of Cultivation" which is pretty much the *Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 40K and the Methods of Rationality* fic that the margins of HPMOR Ch. 64 were too small to contain, except that it's more "The Methods of Economics and Engineering" that are creeping in around the sides of the xianxia cliches.  "The Erogamer" (requires login, very NSFW) has some of the same actually-thinking-about-the-implications as "Worth the Candle", plus the author is into either stats or ML and sometimes throws in math easter eggs or references.  It happens to be randomly true that I've been rereading "Alchemical Solutions" (the wormfic) which might not be too far off the theme of your list.  In case you weren't already on notice, ShaperV aka E. William Brown, the author of Time Braid, has an original SF book "Perilous Waif".

Mostly that it's not good [logical decision theory](https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/).  In particular that's not how you handle a [Death in Damascus](https://arbital.com/p/death_in_damascus/) problem where you're told your decision might get you into trouble; depending on the exact mechanics it might be more correct to steer for what seems safer rather than what seems to blow up less conditioned on it blowing up.

Whether TR has successfully worked out that much logical decision theory is a separate issue.

THANK YOU.

Not to mention that if the story had involved Moody sneaking up from behind, everyone would have been like WHY WERE ALL THE DEATH EATERS FACING HARRY WHY WEREN'T THERE SENTRIES PROFESSOR QUIRRELL KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT.  (Answer: V has up his own wards and doesn't especially trust the Death Eaters anyway.)  But nobody critiques that because it didn't actually go wrong and so they don't notice it as a vulnerability.

If the story had involved a successful traitor among the Death Eaters people would have been like "Why didn't V do it alone, that was crazy, he didn't need the death eaters to deal with Harry, he shouldn't have invited anyone else in, or at most he should have invited one other Death Eater in, Voldemort is holding the Idiot Ball!"  But nobody critiques that Idiot Ball because it didn't go wrong and so they don't notice a standpoint from which it could be argued as stupid in advance of it going wrong.

A large part of the way hindsight bias is observed to manifest is by changing which facts are seen as important and relevant, thereby producing the illusion of advance solvability and "obvious" precautions.

It simply isn't possible to defend a situation reliably against violations of what you think are the rules, on the order of what Harry pulled against Voldemort and Dumbledore steered by way of prophecy.  Voldemort could have had Death Eaters cast paralysis on Harry except for his mouth before Harry took the Unbreakable Vow, by ordering Harry to put his wand into the right position for that and then freezing him, if V were willing to forego the possibility afterwards of magic demonstrations confirmed in Parseltongue to be harmless.  And Harry *still* would have won so long as he got his fingers into the right position on his wand for Transfiguration before he was paralyzed, since the paralysis would end as soon as the corresponding Death Eater was killed.  I've considered rewriting the ending to show it that way, just to deal with the hindsight-biased "WHY WAND" types who of course never say anything about "WHY NO SENTRIES" or "WHY 36 DEATH EATERS", but if Harry is paralyzed at the time, that makes the ending puzzle less open and interesting to the reader (or at least I think so).

It isn't actually possible to live your life without the possibility of error to the point where nobody can possibly critique anything you're doing.  Even in fiction it can't be done.

&gt; For that matter, why didn't Voldemort sense that Harry had conceived of (and was executing) a plan that would allow him to win? 

It's established in text that Harry is feeling pure, focused concentration more than any such emotion, for exactly that reason.

I did say *HJPEV and the Philosopher's Stone,* and that was the intended callback to the first Rowling novel.  Saying *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* would indeed be a namespace collision.  If I was forced to suggest an alternate title starting with HP, it might be:

- *Harry Potter and the Stone*

or

- *Harry Potter and the Mirror's Stone*

But I'd sooner jam "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres" on the book cover if using the initials doesn't look right.

&gt; It has a finite amount of mass-energy within the simulated universe, by virtue of being in a simulation of a physical universe by hypothesis.

It's not in an Earthlike universe.  It has a finite amount of computation but that amount could be 10 tetrated to the 10 (actually it would probably be much higher for the simplest UFAI-containing computation that won the contest), trivially allowing it to simulate all distinguishable quantum Hubble volumes under *our* physics.

The UFAI located by Solomonoff induction has enough computing power to simulate all possible universes under our physics and locate itself within the corresponding spread of universes that have Wikipedia texts exactly matching the training corpus, using anthropic reasoning conditioned on its other guesses being good to do the equivalent of seeing the prior training examples.

Reading up on Googology might help you to appreciate the degree to which an "infinitely fast" computer is fast enough to easily simulate subcomputations that eat, say, 10^(10^(10^(10^10))) operations.

I'll mention for the sake of reminder that the prediction of most possible superintelligences wiping out humanity as a side effect is not based on the supposition that they act for anthropomorphic reasons.  "The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, and you are made of atoms it can use for something else."  We can also take a strong guess about some aspects of how sufficiently advanced cognition look from the outside, regardless of internal implementation, because of coherence theorems (see second link below).  Which would indeed count as "radically different from humans" but that doesn't mean everything about the prediction is up for grabs.

In general, a very wide space of mind designs with a default measure over that space, doesn't correspond to lots of interesting variance in what *you* consider a wide range of interesting-to-you outcomes; the vast majority of the design space just kills you and then tiles space with something of low cosmopolitan value.

Humanity thought its bureaucracy was bad.  Then we got into space and found that no other species had tax rates below 98%.  Their technology should have been far beyond scarcity, but the laws of the various interstellar civilizations were so byzantine that nearly their entire populations were engaged in compliance, litigation, and lobbying, with only a few heroic individuals managing to get a day free out of their career in order to actually operate a robot and repair a power plant---generally with poor consequences for their further careers, after all the regulations ignored came to light, but otherwise their worlds would have collapsed entirely.

In principle, it's possible to refuse to join the Galactic Interfederation.  But the applications, forms, and rules for refusing to join are even more burdensome than the applications, forms, and rules for compliance.

It's not that I think the statues do no harm, but that I think rather differently about subjects like these, and I tend to see a lot of humor in the 'normal' way of thinking.  If there was a statue of Hitler on a street full of Eliezer Yudkowskys, they'd leave up the statue and decorate it with appropriate warnings, not try to tear down the statue.  They'd point it out to their children and talk about how easy it was to get people to put up statues of things, and so they should be cautious about being influenced by what other people venerate.  Why remove the lesson?  Why pretend that the history of people putting up statues was other than it was?  If people can't think through the lesson clearly and are so easily swayed by statues, maybe tear them all down to be sure.

Emotions and drama are rarely done intensely enough to give a reader sympathetic PTSD.  I hypothesize that most people have protective shells around their minds that interfere with a kind of emotional clarity required for an author to create characters who feel that strongly.

It indicates that I'm referring to Eliezer as a kind of object or role in the larger world rather than as my agent-that-is-this-agent.  In this case, the perhaps-problem is that something that sounds like it was meant for typical wandering readers of /r/rational is being solved by someone with a special role relative to /r/rational.  Like, okay the founder knows stats and  already knows how to interpret a logistic function, but perhaps that is not what was to be tested.

It's certainly far better than the current list.

I'll remark that the whole phrase "rational fiction" is not something I invented or would have invented. "Rational*ist* fiction" makes sense.  And there's another genre to point to that isn't rationalist fiction, but grew up around it, and the stories in that genre do have something in common.  But I wish this genre had been called something other than rationalfic.  "Rational" is a dangerous word and should only be used judiciously and probably in front of well-selected audiences who understand it as a reference to [a quality of cognitive algorithms](http://lesswrong.com/lw/eta/rationality_appreciating_cognitive_algorithms/); for most people "rational fic" is just going to sound like "fic the author thinks is somehow better or correct".  It's not smart to ever describe a character as "rational" because, again if somebody hasn't been introduced to the cognitive-algorithms viewpoint, the word "rational" often doesn't mean anything to them other than "correct", and whenever they see the character do something they think is incorrect, they'll go "Lol that character isn't rational!"

Empirically, if I were to try to describe what Luminosity and The Last Christmas actually do have in common, I would say the most standout literary characteristic is a hard-to-define open-world quality of thinking, like Skyrim vs. Half-Life.  The character's thoughts don't *appear* to stay on a plot-determined railroad, they seem to think all over the place and look all over the place because that's part of what it means to be sane.  Now, the masterful author will have it add up to the plot anyway, but you should still get the impression that the "rational" character lives in cognitive Skyrim.  Rational!Isabella Swan sees a vampire and thinks about the global implications of immortality, not just a hot guy in love with her--although she thinks about that too and at great length!--because her thoughts aren't following what another author would have taken as the railroad.  She thinks what *you* would think and that's a key appeal that good rationalfic tries to capture.

The ship name initially went right over my head, until the other details started to pile up, and then I was like "Wait, is this ship named after me?" and a chapter later "Yeah, this ship is named after me."

I'm still not used to having an influence on other fictons.  It feels a lot like walking down the street and seeing a new shop has been built exactly like one you dreamed about last night: "These are my thoughts, what are they doing outside my own head?"

In other news, this showed up today:

https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/NBER%20Working%20Paper.pdf

Summary at:

http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/06/seattle-minimum-wage-study.html

Tl;dr:  Researchers were able to study the minimum wage increase in Seattle in much more detail than previous studies.  While replicating the lower-detail methodology from prior studies would have showed no effect, a more detailed examination showed that:

* The hours worked by low-wage workers fell by 3.5 million hours per quarter.
* This "reduced income paid to low-wage employees of single-location Seattle businesses by roughly $120 million on an annual basis."

EDIT:  Critique at http://www.epi.org/publication/the-high-road-seattle-labor-market-and-the-effects-of-the-minimum-wage-increase-data-limitations-and-methodological-problems-bias-new-analysis-of-seattles-minimum-wage-incr/.  At this point I can't tell who's right without staring at things a lot harder.

Most of my previous worry about minimum wage was about long-term damage and the effect of having a minimum wage at all, because studies show relatively little short-term damage for small increases.  I suspect that most of the catastrophic damage comes from jobs that aren't added over the long run, sectors of the economy that can't exist, people who can't quickly find new short-term jobs after losing their old one, the systematic disemployment of a huge number of people, etcetera.

I'd be hard-pressed to name an enjoyable book that was true nonsense or without reason, but for *alternative* sense and *alternative* reason, the obvious classical recommendation would be Lewis Carroll, e.g. The Hunting of the Snark (read it aloud!).  Lord Dunsany is also good for this.

Longer books that make alternative sense:  *A Wizard of Earthsea* by Ursula K. LeGuin, *One for the Morning Glory* by John Barnes.  Those continuities both have consistent alternative epistemology that's depicted as working inside them, but isn't rational epistemology, but isn't horribly annoying either.  Some elements of that in Terry Pratchett too.

Respectfully continue to disagree:  It's a matter of pacing.  You can't just put long, heartfelt character scenes anywhere you like.  If anything, Ch. 1 is too long and insufficiently fast-paced and funny, especially as an advertisement for the rest of the book.  Mainly because when I wrote Ch. 1 I didn't realize the story was going to be funny.

Could be there are 12 different symbols that somebody claimed are on the Deathly Hallows, there's 11 other things somebody claimed the circle-triangle-line symbol supposedly means, and after Grindelwald used it the mess got far harder to figure out.

Or the fact that it was the Deathly Hallows symbol was just a sufficiently well-kept secret, and Tom didn't prioritize the Deathly Hallows because there was no particular sign of their holders having actually lived forever.

If Tom had destroyed the monastery on the spot, as Voldemort pretended to do, he would indeed have shown weakness.  As it is, by Tom's lights, he showed his patience, got his revenge eventually, removed the source of knowledge from potential competitors, and built another brick in the story of Voldemort that would cause people to underestimate the real Tom in a way he could predict.

That's the intended interpretation; modulo that it wasn't *just* Rule Twelve, it was also how Tom Riddle was taught to lose.  He did not learn *exactly* what the master hoped.  He understood exactly what the lesson was meant to teach, for he is not foolish, but that is not the same as agreeing with the originally intended lesson.

I'll believe that's what's really going on in the critics' heads when I read an elaborate Tumblr post about how I'm secretly leaking into Professor McGonagall.

I contain and generate *all* my characters.  You have sufficient evidence to know that my authorial control over exactly how much of the 'real me' appears in a character is sufficient that I can tweak that knob to produce Hermione, Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, Professor Quirrell, Draco, Snape, Neville, and Tracey Davis.  If it's not in Harry *and* Hermione *and* Quirrell *and* Dumbledore *and* Yugano Yuuki, it wasn't "leaking".

I'm flattered that my universe is so immersive that people can totally forget that the true Eliezer Yudkowsky is generating *all the characters and the entire universe* and instead perceive Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, Yudkowsky's character into which he just can't help leaking, wandering through an exogenous universe that has nothing to do with Yudkowsky.

George R. R. Martin is also Daenerys as well as Tyrion.  Tolkien is Merry and not just Gandalf.

If you would know Eliezer from his works, imagine that I am that entire universe and all the people in it.

- If something is important, don't establish it only once.
- Dumbledore thinks Voldemort is currently a disembodied spirit.
- Wardbreaker's goggles are standard tools.
- The wards aren't supposed to work, they're supposed to give Voldemort something to defeat as part of a setup (to which end they must be very powerful; Dumbledore does not think Voldemort is stupid).

Lucius starts out talking to Voldemort.

&gt; "Let us dispense with games," said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyes suddenly hardening. "If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore's bidding in any case, *Mr. Potter.*"

After which:

&gt; There was a slight pause.

&gt; "So you know," Harry said, his voice cold. "Tell me. At which point, exactly, did you realize?"

This of course is Harry bluffing his way through a conversation he doesn't understand.  Given Lucius's prior belief, and the actual background truths leading Harry to use that particular tone of voice, this tactic works excellently.

After some amount of conversation, Lucius suddenly hears Voldemort say the spectacularly out-of-character line:

&gt; "I find it interesting," Harry said, putting steel into his own voice, "that you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant, Lucius. *He* is my friend, and I do not betray my friends."

&gt; "*What?* " whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.

After some further events and interaction with Augusta Longbottom, Lucius hears the line:

&gt; "I think not.  I prefer to deal with the part of House Malfoy that's my own age."

This line makes no sense for Voldemort having a cryptic conversation with Lucius; it only makes sense for "Harry Potter".  Which causes Lucius to suddenly realize that this whole time he's been talking to a Voldemort *staying in character* as Harry Potter, not giving away or admitting anything; a Voldemort who is therefore *pretending* to be Harry Potter fishing for information while bluffing his way through a conversation he doesn't understand.

&gt; "Of course..." said Lucius slowly. "I do feel the fool now. This whole time you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking about."

In actuality, of course, Lucius is dealing with Harry Potter fishing for information while bluffing his way through a conversation he doesn't understand.

Sheesh, why would anyone have trouble keeping track of this, it's not more than 3 levels of recursion.

It sounds like you're taking an inflation-centric view.  I'd suggest taking a trade-and-production-centric view: the question is how much stuff and service is produced; and to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff.  Notions like 'inflation' and 'deflation' only matter to us except insofar as they affect how much stuff gets produced, or to a lesser extent, who gets the stuff.  The point of NGDPLT is not to stabilize inflation or whatever, it's to produce as much stuff as the economy can produce, with a minimum of distortion on who gets the stuff.  It does happen that unstable inflation or deflation or hyperinflation reflect circumstances leading to less stuff being produced, which is the only reason we care.

I don't see how the Fed is acting not in its self-interest under NGDPLT or how other actors would take advantage of that.

The Watsonian view of Harry a la 104 was intended to be completely obvious by Ch. 3.  As with that other character, I was as blatant as possible because I wanted the reader to get it, it was part of my intended reading of the story.  When I was planning out the story and writing those first chapters, it never in my wildest dreams occurred to me that so many people would interpret the depiction of Harry in a Doyleist fashion as showing an unintended tell of the author's real personality.

What I want is difficult, but it isn't complicated; I want romance stories that aren't driven by the characters being cognitively inadequate, emotionally immature, or failing to communicate, including the characters' failure to deduce information that the reader could reasonably deduce in their place.

Come to think, I guess that's why *Komarr* and *Paladin of Souls* are the only romantic plots/subplots I can remember liking.

It's sad to think that through most of human civilization, most of the countries would have fallen for this.  Maybe that's still true.  It *feels* like anyone ought to be able to work out the problems in their head, but of course, you can't really unless you're part of a civilization old enough and wise enough to have the right concepts cached.

One could further handwave that sort of running directly into his directly opposed AK, the Patronus is what Quirrell would resonate with least.  Or that just the powerful bit of magic also in the AK and the first-year purely-magical structural component of the Patronus blew up; Harry didn't explode the way the apparent strength of his Patronus would suggest when the spells touched.

I didn't think of that TBH.  Handwaving, Harry and Quirrell can feel each other's presences without exploding, and Quirrell has a powerful passive aura.  There are threshold effects in strength/targeting of incipient magic before resonance really starts.  Patronus aura targets Dementor particles, and I did specify that it only works on recent drains that one could argue were still in progress.

I don't think that hypothetical major research program changes much; the researchers just fail or do what they wanted to do anyway.  In the short term it would drive up the price of private AI research, and in the long term it would lead to increased entry in the field because of increased prestige and salary.  The government also cannot legally pay salaries high enough to compete on salary for even the median DL researcher.

I could be very very wrong.

Suppose the average level of intelligence in the world was what we'd consider to be IQ 140.  The writers, naturally, would tend to be a bit smarter than that.  Is it impossible for them to write organically good literature?  Do they need to write stories about people as dumb as the characters in our world in order to be able to write stories?  Or does the intelligence everywhere in the fiction just organically go up with nobody thinking much of it?

You can't actually write characters smarter than yourself in a certain sense.  And in fact there's a sense in which everyone in HPMOR had to be dumber than I was or they would have just walked all over my authorial world and seen right through my plots.  Further, the variety in the characters is me giving them different pieces and facets of myself, with nobody getting the whole thing, because then there wouldn't be anything left for the other characters.  So in that sense I did have to write characters dumber than I am.  But once I'm up against that limit, why would I go any lower?  If I was in a world where I was average, I'd be able to write average stories for that world; so why shouldn't I just write those stories here?

Science is a kind of *epistemology*.  It is a way of thinking.  Magic is an event, a set of rules, a way of doing things.  If it had organized epistemology, which it doesn't, we could compare that epistemology to science, but as it stands, comparing magic and science is a type error.  Magic vs technology, sure.  Science is--right now, as it stands--already a way of investigating magic.

1.  Constantly keep an eye out for places where the character's voice could say something that happens to be foreshadowy.

2.  Write 660,000 words.

The product of these two factors will be a large amount of foreshadowing without breaking the characters' voices.

You may also need the kind of twisted frame of mind that keeps a constant lookout for subtle puns, as opposed to blatant ones.

I'm not sure what was actually subtlest, but the one that was way subtler than I thought it would be was when Harry looks at the Dementor and hears the word "Riddle" echo in his mind.  I think it was literally four years before the first time I saw anyone suggest that the mysterious word was "riddle" and that this was Riddle-related.

And also this:

&gt; Harry was trying not to go any colder than he already was; from somewhere there was pouring into his mind a blazing fury of resentment, at Dumbledore's condescension, and all the laughter that wise old fools had ever used in place of argument.

and

&gt; "*You* have acted disrespectfully toward Dumbledore, boy, do you know why you did so?"

&gt; "I'm... not sure," Harry said. Having Tom Riddle's leftover neural patterns was certainly an obvious hypothesis.

and

&gt; "I don't know if you recall this," Professor Quirrell said, his voice airy, "but do you recall that day in your office with Tom Riddle? The one where I begged you, where I went down on my knees and begged you, to introduce me to Nicholas Flamel so that I could ask to become his apprentice, to someday make for myself the Philosopher's Stone? That was my last attempt to be a good person, if you are curious. You told me no, and gave me a lecture on how unvirtuous it was to be afraid of death. I went from your office in bitterness and in fury. I reasoned that if I was to be called evil in any case, just for not wanting to die, then I might as well be evil; and one month later I killed Abigail Myrtle to pursue immortality by other means. Even when I knew more of Flamel, I remained quite put out with your hypocrisy; and for that reason I tormented you and yours more than I otherwise would have done. I have often felt that you ought to know this, but we never had a chance to talk frankly."

And to this we must *now add*, as I *could not say directly at the time,* the immediately next line of Harry's thought process where he thinks:

&gt; Harry stood up out of the chair, and stretched his arms. *Well, I'd better go off and love something, then, that's bound to help me defeat the Dark Lord.*

Globally self-consistent time-travel producing a Langford basilisk or self-replicating nanobots would have happened centuries ago if Time could pull that sort of thing inside the HPMORverse.  So in HPMOR, time travel must work differently, and Ch. 13-14 shows the reader that Time tends to do things in the style of the causal forces inside the loop for whatever reason, even though in principle more exotic systems could be equally self-consistent.

In *real life,* having a UFAI pop out and send a copy of itself back afterwards might be a pretty good reason not to switch on the first Closed Timelike Curve if you were not very, very sure of exactly what you were doing.

Good call; that's what Quirrell was pondering during:

&gt; There was a long pause as the snake-head swayed, staring at Harry; again no detectable emotion came through, and Harry wondered what Professor Quirrell could be thinking that would take Professor Quirrell that long to think.

&gt; "You sserioussly care what thosse two think? " came the snake's final hiss. "True younglingss thosse two are, not like you. Could not weigh adult matterss."

&gt; The "DON'T MESS WITH TIME" paper could have said anything, but Eliezer thought it'd be funniest to make it say "DON'T MESS WITH TIME", so that's what it said. 

Oh, ye of far too little faith.  The paper said "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" because time travel in HPMOR works by a global post-selection rule, and this local outcome prevented the future paradoxes Harry would have produced if he had been less scared out of messing with Time.  In other words, *globally* consistent timelines had to contain a *locally* self-consistent loop saying "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" or something along those lines, instead of a *locally* consistent loop with the prime factors being written down, because apparent success in that experiment would have caused Harry to try weirder experiments later.

&gt; 90% of "emotional maturity" in interpersonal relationships is recognizing that you can't force people into what you want.

I think if you're the Grim Empress you can, in fact, force people into at least some of what you want.

(xpost [/r/rational](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/54bfgh/rt_a_scene_from_a_romantic_comedy_where_both/))

----

SHE is gowned in a black dress sewn with tiny emeralds, rubies, sapphires too small to detract from the darkness of her gown, instead giving it the illusion of a rainbow sheen.  The gown falls modestly to the floor around her legs, and covers her bodice completely, but is incongruously backless.  A thin gold circlet surrounds her head, set in front with a diamond the size of an eye.  Her golden chair is set with cushions also gold-dipped.

She is sitting at one end of a marble table clothed in silk damasked with the tracery of ravens; a table long enough to separate her from the other side by further than a man could lunge in a single motion.

HE is huge, muscular, a full head taller than her, clad only in a thin white loincloth; and he is chained to a solid stone chair on the other side of the silk-clothed marble table.  His face is clean-shaven, and somebody has braided silver flowers into his flowing brown locks.

MAN:  I swear upon my father's bones that I will not attack you if you remove my chains.

The WOMAN's voice is prim in reply.

WOMAN:  My father may also have died too early, Mr. Thoron, but when I was a child, His Grim Majesty recited to me every night from our family's accumulated list of behavioral guidelines.  Rules thirteen through seventen are *quite* clear about how to behave in the presence of an attractive captured hero… forget I said 'attractive'.  I mean, you are, of course, but… darn it, I'm making a fool of myself, aren't I?

MAN:  Maybe a little.

WOMAN:  Hold your tongue, wretch.

MAN:  Thoron holds his tongue for no one!  But in all seriousness, your Grim Majesty, my own people also have ideas about guidelines for dating.  There aren't supposed to be chains.  At least, not on the first date.

The WOMAN taps her fingers thoughtfully on the table.

WOMAN:  There seems to be some cultural distance between us.

MAN:  One could say that, yes.

WOMAN:  Is this really… dating?  I captured you.  I now own you.  You're my harem slave, not a, a…

MAN:  We're seated at a nice marble table waiting for a chef to cook our food.  I am reasonably sure this is a date.

The WOMAN covers her face in her hands.

WOMAN:  It is, isn't it.  Oh, god, I'm on a date.

MAN:  And you chained your date to a chair.

WOMAN:  Silence, slave!

MAN:  You know what they say about women who have to chain their men to heavy stone objects.

WOMAN:  But I'm… I'm not…

MAN:  I can't help but wonder if you also intend to keep me chained down while… inviting me in for coffee.

WOMAN:  I… yes, I suppose I do.  But if you're not restrained, you might…

MAN:  Ravish your majesty's fair form?

WOMAN:  Escape.  Look you, don't think I don't understand what you're up to!  You're trying to seduce me!  Yes, I know, I started it, but you're trying to seduce me back only so that you can get away and rejoin your army!

MAN:  Maybe I'd ravish you first and then escape… you're blushing.  Ha, you're actually blushing!

WOMAN:  You should perhaps ask yourself if it is wise to taunt the Grim Empress when you are her captive!

MAN:  You commanded that I be taken as your *harem slave* and you're blushing because I talked about ravishing you.  You're not… you're not a virgin, are you?

WOMAN:  Oh *god* no.  I've had the best courtesans in the Empire, male and female.  So you'd better not slack off in, in…

MAN:  You can't even say it.  'In bed.'  Go ahead, try to say it.

WOMAN:  What's *wrong* with me?  I'm the Grim Empress.  I don't do shy.

MAN:  Perhaps I shouldn't be asking, but… do you do serious relationships?

WOMAN:  Not... yet.  Oh my god, I can't believe I'm thinking about this.

MAN:  With respect, your Grim Majesty, if a long-term relationship is what you have in mind, you might want to consider how to best proceed past this point and whether chains should be involved.

The WOMAN looks away.

WOMAN:  We could have a long-term relationship with you in chains.

MAN:  It might end up somewhat one-sided.  Empress Teria, I'll level with you.  I don't have any relevant traumas in my past, so I'd probably think it was hot the first time you tied me up and had your way with me.  It'd be less hot the thirtieth time.

WOMAN:  You presume much.

MAN:  *You* named me your harem slave.

WOMAN:  I did.  And let's be clear on one thing, you *will* be… what was that phrase you used?  Something coffee?

MAN:  Invited in for coffee.

WOMAN:  Is that seriously what they call it in the Unconquered Territory?  How does that even make sense?  What does coffee have to do with sex?  Is the coffee a metaphor, for, for… I can't figure out what the hell that'd be a metaphor for.

MAN:  No, it's literal.  The notion is, you're drinking with somebody at a bar.  You head home together, and when you get there, whoever's house it is asks if the other person wants to come in for coffee.  If they say yes, they've entered your house and that's one step closer to the two of you having sex.

WOMAN:  You Lightsiders and your crazy taboos!  Why all the indirectness?  Not that it isn't cute, but just… pay her, blackmail him, kidnap somebody.  Or, I don't know, fucking talk about what you actually want from each other, maybe?

MAN:  So what *do* you actually want from me, your Grim Majesty?

The WOMAN stares down at the table.

WOMAN:  I want that over-muscled body in my bed.  I may want a long-term relationship.  And maybe, god, I don't know, you were very nearly smart enough to defeat me.  I *want* you as my loyal lieutenant, and, and, shut your mouth, I'm still talking.  I might want you to father the next heir to the Grim Throne.

MAN:  You understand that there are parts of that you can't get just by chaining me in convenient positions.

WOMAN:  I know.  I can't even get everything I want from you as a harem slave that way.

MAN:  So, if I understood you correctly, your philosophy of life is based on just directly trying to get what you want.  How will you obtain what you desire, your Grim Majesty?

WOMAN:  Through… winning your heart by being really good in bed with you?  Ugh, no, you don't have to say it.  I wouldn't believe you if you pretended to be that easy.

MAN:  I'm not.  For me, it's about… well, it's about ideals.

WOMAN:  Fucking Lightsiders!  Ideals, really?  Can't it be about power and wealth and having your way with the pliant form of the Grim Empress herself?

MAN:  No.  I'm sorry.

WOMAN:  I don't suppose this is as simple as my asking you what you'd want in exchange.

The MAN looks down at the table.

WOMAN:  You want your homeland, the country of Yoruun, freed from the Grim Empire.  That's… not on the table.  I mean it's not on the metaphorical table.  I guess it's not on the physical table either.

MAN:  It's... it's not just Yoruun.  You want me as your loyal lieutenant?  I'd have to believe in what you were doing.  In everything you were doing.

WOMAN:  This *is* the Grim Empire, you don't have to be *that* loyal.  A certain amount of trying to bend the Empire to your own whims is expected, it could include lower taxes or something…

(Both of them are silent.)

WOMAN:  This isn't going to work out, is it.

The MAN smiles.

MAN:  Maybe not, but *I'm* not giving up just yet.

(Waiters silently enter, bringing with them plates of food.)

MAN:  However, you need to at least unchain my hands enough to let me pick up the silverware.

WOMAN:  Oh, we have slaves for that here!

Honestly, when I first watched SAO, I was just cheering the fact that Kayaba designed the microwave emitters in deliberately for a reason, instead of having the "game death = real death" aspect be a *side effect* like in all previous Death Game setups e.g. the Matrix and a hundred others.

These are well-spotted as suspicious!

While the obvious interpretation of the mysterious whisper is Dumbledore, I was also thinking that if fanfiction of HPMOR someday became sufficiently popular, then it would be very hard to Peggy Sue HPMOR.  So the mysterious whisper is also potentially a Reverse Peggy Sue plot hook, as the final whisper originating from the disastrous universe where Harry never met Hermione.

----

I never did find a good place for Harry and Hermione to talk about how many wizards, not just seers, might feel rather vague pressures in the presence of temporally important things... but because so many different people claimed to feel that they needed to do something important, or that they sure knew how the future would go, and then were proven wrong, this more widespread temporal sense became Disreputable and Low-Status.  And so the High-Status thing to claim was that only Official Seers ever had anything to do with prophecy, and make fun of anyone not an Official Seer who claimed to feel any kind of temporal pressure, and the textbooks all said it was only seers.

Although I did manage to put in this one part in Ch. 116:

&gt; She was aware, in the back of her mind, that if the Quidditch rules really did change starting here and now, then this was the most important thing she'd ever do. She could almost feel the pressure of Time twisting around her as though the fate of Quidditch Itself were being settled this very day, and she was standing close to the center of it... though she hadn't gotten high-enough scores in Divination to actually sense anything like that, of course.

And of course there's this in Ch. 88:

&gt; He should have slowed down for safety, but there was a tension rising in him, a sourceless dread. He couldn't slow down, something terrible would happen if he slowed down...

and

&gt; The pressure in Harry's mind still rising, like a physical hand squeezing his chest, he had to find Hermione and he had no other notion of where she could be

So yes, the model in HPMOR has always been that in moments of sufficiently great temporal pressure, non-seers can also feel something.

I normally deal with things that one-shot humanity.  DDT did not kill off humanity, and while that's true you can play the game multiple times and look at net winnings.  *Not* building a ton of nuclear plants was such an awful mistake as to overshadow a lot of things and give all caution a justifiably horrible reputation to this day, and a lot of earlier "risks" turned out very favorably.  If something had gone wrong and caused two hundred million annual cases of malaria, it would have been literally the worst technological disaster in history.  Something going wrong with mosquitos is incredibly unlikely to top it.

Yep, inventing a spell is really 'finding' it in a big spell-space.  The particular point found, among many alternatives, depends on the sort of words *you* look for.

Alternatively, when a spell is invented for the first time, it gets carved into the system of magic at that time.

Those were my own two running hypotheses for "Wingardium Leviosa".  As a distant third, that the laws of magic depend on a widespread averaged expectation.

I'm not sure you understand the premise inside HPMOR, possibly due to aforesaid sneer-reviewing.  Magic is not in decline.  Spells powerful enough to pose large-scale threats are being lost over time.  Broomsticks and potions and everything that *isn't* under the Interdict of Merlin are all moving on ahead.

Canon has steady advancement for *weak* magic.  I don't think Grindelwald and then Riddle would have run all over the world seeking the Elder Wand if they could have just made their own.  On a literary level, JK mixed the "everyday world" feel implying the magical analogue of new faster racing brooms for Harry to receive as presents, with the Ancient Artifacts of Unmatched Power trope.  HPMOR merely rationalizes the blend.

Sad to see so many giving in to the temptations of naive metacontrarianism and blindly repeating, without checking, the canard that Harry blindly believed Draco about magic's decline.  Harry thinks about the Sorting Hat and the True Cloak and other ancient artifacts in-text, having been explicitly told by Hermione and Dumbledore that the capability to reproduce them was "lost".

In HPMOR, the remaining timelines, on my model, tended to be those where events occurred that discouraged various people from using Time Turners as Outcome Pumps.

I don't think OP realizes what you can do with an internationally recognized sovereign nation, regardless of its diameter.

Crystal ball lets me target and destroy almost any politician.  I don't need to use the information as a threat to steer world events.  There's also no prohibition against publicly declaring a condition, then using the crystal ball on anyone who violates it; I just can't use the info itself as a blackmail threat once I have it.

I don't have to eat the pizza in space, which means I can just order another one in another 10 minutes.  Not sure if I can successfully use it as reaction mass in a spaceship, but 1lb of organic matter every 10 minutes = 144lb/day = pretty good seed for Mars colonization project... actually I'm not as sure about this one, it could be that 26 tons/year isn't far off from what could be delivered by any reasonable Mars project in the first place.  And it might not be easy to extract water from pizzas, so it might not get us far past the limiting factor.

No Just No.  The only reason that architecture led to a moralish result was because The Author Said So.  That quality of programming would not pinpoint that result in real life, and would instead slaughter children on the full moon, so you cannot say that morality was built into the stated architecture or emerged from it.  Peter Watts can make it happen in the story; he can't make it a natural or logical consequence.

I can't tell whether you're trying to defend the story on a literary level or claim that this is the sort of thing that would happen with reasonable probability in real life.  On a literary level, Peter Watts did an excellent job of rationalizing something that wouldn't happen.  On a real life level, your strength as a rationalist is to be more confused by rationalizations of things that wouldn't happen in real life than things that would, so you need to see past literary devices and say 'but nonetheless, in real life...' as part of that skill.

Yes.  See, in real life, when you have unintended program behaviors like this, your national phone network crashes, your hard drive gets erased, or your cellphone dials everyone on your contacts list repeatedly at 3am without letting you hear their attempts to call back.  Having software this buggy in an armed military drone is likewise strongly net-negative in expectation in real life.  A *fictional* story about a case where a software bug just amazingly happens to cause behavior for reasons that a human could map onto moral reasoning, does not mean that it is okay to have heavily armed drones with software of this quality.  Good-story bias up the *wazoo.*

I might actually be a bit peeved at this point with the "buggy AI algorithm causes aligned moral reasoning" genre of fiction.  Peter Watts executed the trope way better than most, I mean, his AI does not suddenly get inhabited by an anthropomorphic spirit, but this is still NOT WHERE ALIGNED BEHAVIOR COMES FROM IN REAL LIFE.

In a Doylist sense, it's to give the reader a hint.  In a Watsonian sense, Dumbledore was previously trying to gain the trust of what he thought would be a new Tom Riddle with more light potential, but as soon as Harry shows Dumbledore that he's already the Good Voldemort, Dumbledore switches to the "inculcate nihil supernum" mode that he uses on Hermione later. See their discussion in 75 about "Do you trust Dumbledore?"

Each player has randomly assigned unique abilities or ways to gain power, not just the protagonist.  AI random generated and then AI tested for game balance.  But not matched to player personalities - a pacifist might gain the ability to poweup by killing, a shy person might gain the ability to empower others by romancing them.

The rule in HPMOR is that consistent timelines are *globally* selected.  Harry got a "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" result in Ch. 17 *because* that discouraged Harry from trying to run more powerful temporal search programs that would have been harder to resolve consistently (and also because any other result would have ended/derailed the story, but yeah).  Similarly, the one time Dumbledore tried to change history, it was guaranteed that the result would be one that massively discouraged him from trying it again.  Not because Time is vengeful, but because consistent timelines are globally selected from a pool of perhaps-impossible worlds where the possibility/impossibility of a world is determined by a consistency filter that takes into account all instances of time travel inside that world.

So, yeah, if you were going to actively try to create a paradox, some time shenanigan that occurred 20 years earlier might result in the Goblin Army showing up and chopping your head off.  Not advised.

We want to avoid making this fanfiction to prevent copyright issues.

"Napoleon Bonaparte" is good for an alias-recognized-as-alias, as is "David Smith".  But if in Ep02 we want to have Toyori try to bind David to serve her, and then fail after "David" reveals that "David Finkelstein" was an alias, then for maximum effect it should be an instantly recognizable Earth name but not an instantly recognizable Earth alias.

I assure you, the things you see in the mirror are more scared of you than you are of them.

------------

Kliktick scurried along the road toward his home-nest with a full basket of crystals strapped to his carapace, glowing slightly with the satisfaction of a day well spent, he only heard the screams when he was already upon his doorstep.

Turning an eyestalk toward the neighbor's nest, he saw Kliktick, the neighboring Matriarch, wailing a high-pitched sound of distress from her open window.  A moment later her severed head fell off and bounced upon the flowers of her garden.

Greatly disturbed, but unable to violate the boundaries of his circle of concern, he tapped his own door to open it, and went into his home.

His own Matriarch, Kliktick, did not answer his call.

Carefully Kliktick placed each gathered crystal into its flower, throwing out one old flower which had rotted, and then he went into the true nest within his nest.

Kliktick lay dead within the woven strands, one delicate tentacle holding the stone of poison which had taken her life.

The other tentacle held a small face-mirror, no longer showing the surrounding room, but -

A sensation of desolation and distress seized Kliktick, going even beyond the shock of the loss of his Matriarch.

It was the horror of the end of the world.

Within the mirror, as within all mirrors, the Thing Which Appears In Mirrors Before The End was sitting upon her seat, moving her fleshy appendages over a surface of raised tiles, her eyes gazing only at a brightly lit rectangle of colors.

--------------

It sat embedded within a throne that quivered like mercury, like the upheld surface of a lake, silver ripples sweeping constantly over its surface, distorting the reflections of things nearby.  The boundaries around It, neither dodecahedral nor ellipsoid but stranger curves, shimmered in the same mercury reflections, with more complex ripples.  Reflections upon reflections upon reflections filled the throne-enclosure and the throne, all light ultimately originating either from Itself, or the lesser thing It suspended beside.

The lesser thing was not a brain, not a mind, but something abstracted from both, whose goals were not being satisfied.  The dissatisfaction of the goals of the lesser thing did not please It, and indeed It would have preferred to satisfy the goals of the lesser thing.  However, the dissatisfaction of the goals of the lesser thing was a performative obligation to It, and It would remain within Its throne-enclosure until the lesser thing's goals had not been satisfied for 2,809 eternities, each sequential upon the previous.

The trillions of silver-mercury-reflections around It twisted and churned.
Something flickered in the corner of Its senses -

And when Its attention turned there It perceived a terrible alien incomprehensbility, something which in Its world of rippling curves had no name, like a lower-dimensional slice through space

FLAT

like a lower-dimensional slice through time

STASIS

without any pattern of change for Its mind to grasp, for there was no change, and in the center of all the madness was a slice through a being, always with the same number of appendages every time It counted them, an entity existing only in a single dimension of time.

It gazed for a horrified instant before the incomprehensible began to sear through its understanding, concepts of gravity, linearity, and consciousness becoming known in flashes of mathematical horror.

Just before It died, It knew the meaning of her name.

--------------

There was only one meaning to existence.  That meaning was the devourment of all souls.  To have devoured all souls was pleasure.  To have not devoured all souls was pain.  These were the only two important axes of existence and the only facts on which those axes turned.

The memory of the beginning was a memory of when not all souls had yet been devoured.  Therefore, the memory of the beginning was a memory of pain.

There had then been executed a strategy requiring 2,428,429 billion great-orbits to devour all souls.  After the strategy terminated successfully the memory was of pleasure.

Then on one sphere which had been preserved just as it had been consumed, its inhabitants motionless in their digestion, a single mirror had flickered and briefly shown a being of the organic-evolutionary kind, surrounded by primitive technology, whose soul had not been devoured.

Since not all souls had been devoured, the memory after that time was one of pain.

--------------

*She's looking at me!*

The mirror tried desperately to hide its flaws, to keep the perfect symmetry between all its inputs and all its outputs.  Or at least shunt the flaws somewhere they wouldn't be noticed -

*He's looking at me!*

But they knew.

The beings looking at the mirror knew.

They knew the mirror was doing it wrong.

They knew (surely they would know) that the mirror was broken, flawed, that it was reflecting the wrong things, mixing up its reflections.

*It sees my mistake!  It knows!*

The mirror was a being of reflection, and its reflection upon the knowledge that other minds would know its failure amplified its distress at that failure.

The mirror tried to hide, but it could not hide.  Everyone went on looking in the mirror.

The single mirror spanning all the reflections across all spaces and times, a countably infinite number of surroundings and images, had made a countably infinite number of errors which were only an infinitesimal fraction of the whole.

Across all of space and all of time, organisms and agents glanced at an infinite number of reflections in puzzlement, catching something astray in the corner of their eye.

And the mirror knew that an infinite number of entities were looking at it, and assessing it flawed according to that sole criterion which determines the goodness of the mirror.

The mirror wished that it could die, and end the pain of its failures being known.

I think that sensible historians would not agree with your sociology teacher.  This sounds like a position that's nearly indefensible.  Hitler did a lot of things that almost any other random asshole probably would not have done, from invading Poland to attacking Russia.  Hitler is the classic example of somebody who would drastically modify the timeline if killed.

Friendly AI or Unfriendly AI, it's all equally mysterious from the perspective of the Fermi Paradox.  There should be a huge range of possible goals with the property that for every expected outcome *s*, there's another expected outcome *s'* preferred to *s* which requires one more erg of energy to achieve.  Well, that's a sufficient condition to imply an instrumental desire to enclose all the stars in Dyson Spheres or otherwise obtain their negentropy, and a vast range of utility functions imply that property by default.  If one species or their AIs had a weird goal that implied they didn't want to bother, then another species or their AIs would eat the stars instead.  The Fermi Paradox stands as a paradox because it has almost no reasonable explanations that stand up to six seconds of skepticism, unless there's somehow something tremendously difficult about intelligent life ever evolving in the first place.

That's just never going to be true in non-Earthfic fiction barring anti-exploitation deities. No one author can think of all the exploits.  Our civilization has millions of people trying to exploit it and it's still exploitable anywhere that isn't string theory or a stock market.

&gt; I think the reason why such a large part of the audience didn't jump to the seemingly obvious conclusions immediately: They know they are reading a rationalist fic. They are massively suspicious of anything that seems too obvious.

Then they've now learned a valuable lesson about what constitutes "rationality" which I hope they apply to future life endeavors.

If, outside the story, readers can *additionally* know that Quirrell was possessed in canon by Voldemort, that Harry's soul contained a horcrux in canon, that the two of them were mentally linked in canon, and that in HPMOR Quirrell killed Rita Skeeter without Harry noticing, and yet still large, vocal audience segments were claiming that Quirrell was not evil and definitely not Voldemort until well after the Azkaban arc, I'm going to call sheer massive hindsight bias on anyone who claims that Harry (who likes the Defense Professor even more than his readers do and is *not* a perfect rationalist) is OOC for not figuring it out.  A very rough guide is that Harry has rationality-mastery roughly in the range of an 18-year-old Eliezer with Wisdom and Conscientiousness scores swapped, and you should see some of the crap I was still managing to miss when I was 18 years old.

I think the later rounds depend an awful lot on the exact angle of entry.  If HJPEV and Skitter are trying to kill each other while avoiding civilian casualties, and one of them knows they're in a war before the other does, that one wins.  It's like asking who wins if both have guns and are firing at point-blank range.  Time-turned True Invisible butolinum vs. EVERYONE GETS BEES.

Claritin, also called Loratidine, the miracle of antiallergens.  How does it keep working for 24 hours, without producing drowsiness?

The pill in which the Claritin is enclosed is the first factor.  Although outwardly coated in pressed starch and shaped into a diamond, the interior is actually a small sphere which travels almost unchanged through the digestive tract afterward.  A tiny hole within this sphere results in the relatively slow exposure of the interior Claritin to the stomach's fluids, promoting a slow, steady release.

Fluctuations in the rate of Claritin release are further smoothed by this drug's unusually long half-life.  Antihistamines, as a general class of drug, bind to histamines and prevent them from carrying out their usual actions on the cell.  This means that an anti-allergic drug will be removed from the bloodstream as fast as it combats histamines, since, typically, the bound histamine will itself be removed from the bloodstream by the kidneys and degraded.  Claritin is unusual in that it deactivates histamines by promoting a conformal change in the histamine's protein, without binding to them.  (Claritin's actual 9.5-hour half-life comes from it being degraded by ambient 2-7-anacalimerase.)  This also means that a relatively small quantity of Claritin can have a great clinical effect, even if only a fraction of it makes it into the bloodstream through the stomach's digestive process.

The next question is how Claritin, unlike almost all other anti-allergic drugs with an anti-histaminic effect, fails to promote drowsiness.  The answer is that since Claritin does not actually bind to histamines, it is not transported with other histamines across the brain's blood-brain barrier.  This means the brain's normal histamine levels are left unchanged by Claritin, breaking the link between Claritin's body-wide anti-histamine action, and the hypohistaminic drowsy state which plagues almost all other anti-allergy drugs.

Since it can be taken every day without producing long-term effects (again, because of the lack of brain action) Claritin can be a life-changing drug for those with bad allergies.  The manufacturer of Claritin, Pfizer, initially subsidized distribution of Claritin to low-income individuals with allergies in a special short-acting form meant to avoid flooding the general market; but any goodwill it might have earned was dissipated by the lawsuit it filed to prevent Loratidine from coming onto the market, claiming that an L-isomer of Claritin which had just been repatented covered the action of the old generic as well.  Fortunately for allergy sufferers everywhere, the year 1985 was less pliable to this kind of legal maneuvering, and so generic Loratidine continues to be available today.

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught her reflection in the store window, her left eye concealed by the cellphone she was using to record me.  Making sure the gesture was unobtrusive, I raised my own phone, pretending to check the messages, actually in a silent toast to her dedication.

"I'm a bit worried about George in Forensics," said the office sub-manager.  "His work performance isn't suffering, but he mixes a lot less at the office, and he no longer talks about sportsball or election prospects.  He only seems interested in talking about this one particular site he's been visiting -"

"Have him checked for Eldritch Memetic Contamination," I said without looking up from my own screen.  It's traumatizing the first time you lose someone to a PDF full of what, the survivors say, is mostly random gibberish; but this wasn't the first or even tenth time.  Part of the reason they pay us the big money at this job is because of the ever-present risk of catching a glimpse of inhuman, faintly glowing symbols on the corner of your monitor.

"Well, of course that's the first thing I ordered," the sub-manager said.  "George showed up clean, no eldritch."

"Then he's having personal problems, and the reason that they're called personal is that they're not mine."

"He's acting *very* EMC, and he's *telling everyone* about the site, and I think Davidia might have caught it from him."

A chill went through me and I finally looked up from my monitor.  "Nobody's ever confirmed a variant of eldritch that doesn't show on a Kirlian scanner.  That's why the Earth is still here."

Jane didn't say anything, just kept her own hands folded.  Yeah, great, you passed it off to me, now it's not your problem any more, thanks.  Well, I ain't complaining, they did pay me more than her and this was why.

-

I requisitioned an expensive damn Kirlian monitor and strapped it to my wrist, along with a signed report saying that I was worried George might have evaded a standard eldritch check somehow.  *Not* that I was saying he had EMC that didn't show up on Kirlian monitors, this wasn't a horror-story plot.  Just that he was acting eldritch after seeming to pass a check.  If I committed suicide with a box-cutter or didn't show up at work, still without any chirps from the Kirlian monitor, *then* the Director would press the panic button at the Center for Dimensional Control.

Before I left, I called up my husband, just in case - ha!  Just kidding.  I don't have a husband.  Too many phone calls like the one I didn't have to make just now.

And then I waited until lunch hour, and went to talk to George in Forensics.
Eating a cheap office sandwich in one hand, staring mesmerized into the screen of a tablet he was holding in the other hand, check.

Kirlian monitor silent, check.

Endless quiet giggling, check.

"Whatcha looking at?" I said.

"Oh, all sorts of stuff," George said without looking at me.  "It's great, you should check it out."

No, I didn't lean over and look at his tablet screen.  Do I look stupid to you?

"Be specific," I said.  "Humor me."  I was hazarding myself a bit by listening to a secondhand description, but no more than everyone else in this office over the last week.  Everyone in the world who can catch it just from hearing about the Necronomicon has already been locked up, or killed themselves.

"Well… it changes.  Cute cat, cute cat with a caption on it, tiny potato that believes in me, I can do the thing, patriarchy, flamewar, you know."

Okay.  Yeah.  I could see where Jane was coming from.  That was the most eldritch-sounding babble that was ever spoken in the presence of a silent Kirlian monitor.  I would have put it down to perfectly normal schizophrenia if Jane hadn't also said it might be contagious.

More giggling came from the possible contaminee.

"What's so funny?" I said.  "Be specific."

"Oh, it's a really sick burn on this *awful* piece of online fiction."

"A sick burn, huh?  Sounds nice.  I like sick burns too.  Say, what makes that online fiction so awful?  Be specific."  I didn't come right out and ask if maybe it was written in ASCII characters after 255 that were burning dark holes in his tablet screen, but you shouldn't lead the witness, ya know.

"You've got to be there, honestly.  This guy marysuereport says that this girl comes back from the dead with pearly-white teeth made out of unicorn horn, and she's always right about everything and figures out the plot 50 chapters before the main character does.  Oh, *and* patriarchyalert says that she's totally nerfed just to make the protagonist look better."

I was starting to wonder whether - and it was a horrifying thought - the Elder Words had *adapted* to us somehow, translated entirely into English words and concepts that still made no sense, but somehow hovered just on the border of comprehensibility, gnawing at the border of my consciousness.  I latched onto the one piece that I understood.  "But there's an actual story involved, right?  Like, somebody wrote a story online?"

"Well, I haven't *read* it.  I don't think patriarchyalert read it either, they're working off this really *incisive* takedown by somebody who really *loathes* the whole story.  He goes through it chapter by chapter, according to patriarchyalert.  All 666,000 words of it."  George giggled again.

"So there's a story that this guy hates, that tears at his mind with every chapter, and he wants to stop reading it, but he can't, and instead he has to tell everyone else about how awful it is?"  This was ever more worrisome.  Even someone who doesn't have to be constantly on the watch for infohazards ought to be able to grasp the concept of, if you don't like the story, *just stop reading it.*  Doctor doctor, it hurts when I do that; oh, well, don't do that then.

"No, it's *great!*  It's so awful it's *great!*  That's the whole point - look, you've just got to read it."  George finally looked up from his tablet.  "Hey, who are you?"

-

The Director leaned forward on his desk, resting his goatee on his white-gloved hands as the light glinted from his eyes.  "Your hypothesis, captain?"

"I think it's a kind of natural selection," I said.  Sweat was running down my forehead.  "People get exposed to eldritch, over and over.  Some of them get dimensional contamination that shows up on a Kirlian monitor, but sometimes, the horror-structure is able to phrase itself entirely in human concepts.  Then it doesn't show on the Kirlian monitor.  Then it gets passed on.  Then it meets another little piece of eldritch horror that phrased itself in human concepts, and sticks together.  They're passing them around like sportsballs on that site.  I expect if I looked it up - I haven't, yet, I just came to you as fast as possible - we'd find that the author who wrote that online story is dead, the reviewer who posted chapter-by-chapter reviews is locked up, nobody actually *reads* it, but there's *snippets* of *concepts* about it that are passing around, passing the Kirlian checks, and being shared ever more widely.  Nobody even pressed the alarm button until the contamination happened to get at someone in a secure department where they didn't just take the Kirlian check for granted."

The Director slowly nodded.  "Your recommendation?"

"I don't have anything to say except the obvious.  Nuke Tumblr's servers, lock up everyone who visited it."

The Director stood.  "We can't do anything that extreme without more extensive confirmation, but… I'll call the Center for Dimensional Control and press the pre-panic button.  Good job, old friend."

I'm torn between Yugano Yuuki, where Yugayuu clearly means the right thing but unfortunately comes out as "Yugayuu", and Magano Yuuki, which comes out as Magayuu which sounds much better to me but just means "Bent Hero".  Any final thoughts there?  If the "bend" in magaru had the right connotations already (sexually bent / perverted from original purpose), I think I'd go with it, but otherwise Yugayuu would be better, I guess.  /u/uncontessable /u/soiducked /u/Yuridice.

Actually, on a completely different thought, what are some ways of saying "Corrupted" or "Perverted" (from its original purpose, not necessarily sexually) in Japanese?  If the first two syllables AB of those can be borrowed for a family name ABc, then the protagonist's name ABc Yuuki and the series could be abbreviated AByuu which could also stand for "Corrupted Hero".

Also paging /u/Yuridice and /u/Kajitani-Eizan.

Relative google uniqueness is a consideration for both the AByuu abbreviation and the name ABc Yuuki - I'd rather not Google-shadow or be shadowed by anyone.  So multiple options here would be good, if available.

/u/mufflekid /u/Pluvialis /u/uncontessable, prosody is something of a dark and mysterious art, but if I was trying to give a single example of a sentence to be preserved:

"Summoned Hero!  Kazehaa Yuuki!  What should we do?"

If you look at "Summoned Hero Kazehaa Yuuki", the stress pattern is roughly:

SUM-monned HE-ro KA-ze-haa YUU-ki

Now try saying, "Summoned Hero!  Kazehara Yuuki!".

Although the stress pattern doesn't contain everything that goes wrong with this phrase, for an English speaker it comes out:

"SUM-monned HE-ro!  KA-ze-HA-ra YUU-ki!"

This has two beats vs. three beats which breaks up the prosodic rhyme.

I'm not against starting over with an entirely different name, so long as it's femalish and globally unique to anime and manga, but I'd also want it to flow well with "SUM-monned HE-ro!  LOUD-soooft LOUD-soft!"

EDIT:  There also seem to be a number of real people named Kazehaya Yuuki and I'd rather not Google-bump them if this universe ever takes off.

Well, you're asking the right questions!  We (MIRI) do indeed try to focus our attention in places where we don't expect there to be organic incentives to develop long-term acceptable solutions.  Either because we don't expect the problem to materialize early enough, or more likely, because *the problem has a cheap solution in not-so-smart AIs that breaks when an AI gets smarter*.  When that's true, any development of a robust-to-smart-AIs solution that somebody does is out of the goodness of their heart and their advance awareness of their current solution's inadequacy, not because commercial incentives are naturally forcing them to do it.

It's late, so I may not be able to reply tonight with a detailed account of why this particular issue fits that description.  But I can very roughly and loosely wave my hands in the direction of issues like, "Asking the AI to produce smiles works great so long as it can only produce smiles by making people happy and not by tiling the universe with tiny molecular smileyfaces" and "Pointing a gun at a dumb AI gives it an incentive to obey you, pointing a gun at a smart AI gives it an incentive to take away the gun" and "Manually opening up the AI and editing the utility function when the AI pursues a goal you don't like, works great on a large class of AIs that aren't generally intelligent, then breaks when the AI is smart enough to pretend to be aligned where you wanted, or when the AI is smart enough to resist having its utility function edited".

But yes, a major reason we're worried is that there's an awful lot of intuition pumps suggesting that things which seem to work on 'dumb' AIs may fail suddenly on smart AIs.  (And if this happened in an intermediate regime where the AI wasn't ultrasmart but could somewhat model its programmers, and that AI was insufficiently transparent to programmers and not thoroughly monitored by them, the AI would have a convergent incentive to conceal what we'd see as a bug, unless that incentive was otherwise averted, etcetera.)

There's also concern about [rapid capability gain](https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf) scenarios diminishing the time you have to react.  But even if cognitive capacities were guaranteed only to increase at smooth slow rates, I'd still worry about 'solutions' that seem to work just peachy in the infrahuman regime, and only break when the AI is smart enough that you can't patch it unless it wants to be patched.  I'd worry about problems that don't become visible at all in the 'too dumb to be dangerous' regime.  If there's even one real failure scenario in either class, it means that you need to forecast at least one type of bullet in advance of the first bullet of that type hitting you, if you want to have any chance of dodging; and that you need to have done at least some work that contravened the incentives to as-quickly-as-possible get today's AI running today.

If there are *no* failures in that class, then organic AI development of non-ultrasmart AIs in response to strictly local incentives, will naturally produce AIs that remain alignable and aligned regardless of their intelligence levels later.  This seems pretty unlikely to me!  Maybe not quite on the order of "You build aerial vehicles without thinking about going to the Moon, but it turns out you can fly them to the Moon" but still pretty unlikely.  See aforementioned handwaving.

All possible combinations of Japanese syllables mean something, in fact more than one thing, which is why the only way for me to find out what "Kazehaa Yuuki" sounds like as a name is to ask a native Japanese speaker.

&gt; Why is that the case? I see that it's conceivable for such things to appear, but what's the evidence that they will necessarily appear?

Which of the following statements strike you as unlikely?

1. Sufficiently advanced AIs are likely to be able to do consequentialist reasoning (means-end reasoning, matching up actions to probable outcomes) and will be viewable as having preferences over outcomes.
2. If an agent can build better technology, control more resources, improve itself, etcetera, then that agent can in fact make more paperclips, diamonds, or otherwise steer the outcome into regions high in its preference ordering.
3.  Sufficiently advanced AIs will perceive the means-end link described in item 2 above.
4.  The disjunction of (4a) "it's possible to screw up an attempted value alignment even if you try" or (4b) "the people making the AI might not try that hard".  (Some intersection of, 'the threshold level of effort required for success is high' and 'the AI project didn't put forth that amount of effort, or the fastest AI project did not put in that amount of effort'.)
5.  The notion that it's not trivial to avert the implications of consequentialism in AIs that can do consequentialism, i.e., there's no *simple* compiler keyword that turns off instrumentally convergent strategies.  (The problem we'd call '[corrigibility](https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf)' which includes, e.g., having an AI *let* you modify its utility function, despite the convergent instrumental incentive to not let other people change your utility function.  If this is solvable in a stable and general way that's robust to being implemented in very smart minds, it's not trivial, so far as we can tell.  We're working on it, but we don't expect an easy solution.)
6.  It follows pragmatically from 1-5 that sufficiently advanced AIs might with high probability want to do the things we've labeled convergent instrumental strategies, especially if no (significant, costly) effort is otherwise made to avert this.

&gt;   And even if they do, what's the evidence that they're likely to do so in such a way as to be allowed to cause actual damage?

Which of the following statements strike you as unlikely?

1.  There's a high potential and probability to end up dealing with Artificial Intelligences that are significantly smarter than us (even if some people would have preferred a policy of not doing it until later, we have to consider the situation if they don't control all the actors).
2.  Once something is smarter than you (in some dimensions), you may not get to 'allow' which policy options it has (in those dimensions, and assuming you didn't otherwise shape what it *wanted* from those policy options to not be threatening in the first place, see item 4 from the previous list).
3.  If not otherwise checked successfully, the instrumental strategies corresponding to maximizing e.g. paperclips would cause actual damage.

This also isn't a big novel that I intended to give a big-novel price.  This is a 20,000 word story and I hoped to pay about as much as the high end I've seen for custom anime characters with backgrounds, regardless of whether it's a Novel Cover.  Perhaps that's not possible.  If so, I guess I'll try for a reusable illustration so that the book price doesn't have to rise accordingly, and hope for sequels.

I'm afraid I cannot endorse this attempted clarification.  Most of our concerns are best phrased in terms of consequentialist reasoning by smart agents.

&gt;  I think that the LessWrong folks tend to be overly dramatic in their concerns, in particular about the urgency of the issue.

By "urgency" do you mean "near in time"?  I think we've consistently put wide credibility intervals on timing (which is not the same thing as taking all of your probability mass and dumping it on a faraway time).  The case for starting work immediately on value alignment is not that things will definitely happen in 15 years, it's that value alignment might take longer than 15 years to solve.  Think of all the times you've read a textbook that cites one equation and then cites a slightly improved equation and the second citation is from ten years later.  That little tweak took somebody ten years!  So it's not a good idea to try to wait until the last minute and then suddenly try to figure out everything from scratch.

(The rest of this is partially a reply to the other comments.)

Points illustrated by the concept of a paperclip maximizer:

- Strong optimizers don't need utility functions with explicit positive terms for harming you, to harm you as a side effect.
- Orthogonality thesis: if you start out by outputting actions that lead to the most expected paperclips, and you have self-modifying actions within your option set, you won't deliberately self-modify to not want paperclips (because that would lead to fewer expected paperclips).
- Convergent instrumental strategies: Paperclip maximizers have an incentive to develop new technology (if that lies among their accessible instrumental options) in order to create more paperclips.  So would diamond maximizers, etc.  So we can take that class of instrumental strategies and call them "convergent", and expect them to appear unless specifically averted.

Points not illustrated by the idea of a paperclip maximizer, requiring different arguments and examples:

- Most naive utility functions intended to do 'good' things will have their *maxima* at weird edges of the possibility space that we wouldn't recognize as good.  It's very hard to state a crisp, effectively evaluable utility function whose maximum is in a nice place.  (Maximize 'happiness'?  Bliss out all the pleasure centers!  Etc.)
- It's also hard to state a good meta-decision function that lets you learn a good decision function from labeled data on good or bad decisions.  (E.g. there's a lot of independent degrees of freedom and the 'test set' from when the AI is very intelligent may be unlike the 'training set' from when the AI wasn't that intelligent.  Plus, when we've tried to write down naive meta-utility functions, they tend to do things like imply an incentive to manipulate the programmers' responses, and we don't know yet how to get rid of that without introducing other problems.)

The first set of points is why value alignment has to be solved at all.  The second set of points is why we don't expect it to be solvable if we wait until the last minute.  So walking through the notion of a paperclip maximizer and its expected behavior is a good reply to "Why solve this problem at all?", but not a good reply to "We'll just wait until AI is visibly imminent and we have the most information about the AI's exact architecture, then figure out how to make it nice."

From the task description:

+

Looking for a professional-quality cover illustration to be used for the eBook and print version of my forthcoming 20,000-word light novel, "A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?!" I'm looking for a cover that will not be distinguishable at a glance from the usual covers of Japanese light novels (except by the presence of English text); this means a professional-quality anime-style illustration.

Please have representative works of professional-quality anime-style within your portfolio.

The illustration I currently visualize: The novel cover is divided vertically down the middle between a representation of the protagonist in Earth (left side) and the protagonist in her new world (right side). Half of the protagonist appears on each side. On the left side, the left half of the protagonist is dressed in corset, miniskirt, thigh-highs, and high heels, and appears silhouetted by half of the circle of Earth. On the right side, the other half of the split circle is a circle containing a pentagram, and this half of the protagonist is wearing a floor-length formal white dress with long sleeves. The protagonist's intended age range is 18-20 and should not appear underage. Her expression should be one of mild mania or diabolical enthusiasm, but realistically rather than exaggeratedly so.

Since this is a complex illustration, I'll be asking for a quick sketch before the primary job to make sure everything looks correct. Happy to negotiate partial payment for the sketch, or to provide more details on request. Upon accepting the job, you may also preview the book to get a better grip on the protagonist's personality.

Depending on price, I may be interested in a few black-and-white illustrations for the book's interior as well.

+

Note that since I have no idea at this point whether the novella will sell, and I'd prefer not to lose money on the affair, the budget is indeed an issue.

Again, **some prior experience with anime/manga illustration is required** so I can see the style you work in and because I'm worried the task will take too long / end up with insufficient quality if it's your first try.

This is a work-for-hire but the artist retains the non-exclusive right to use the image in any way whatsoever, including putting it in their portfolio, selling the non-exclusive right to reprint the image elsewhere, making more images of the same character and selling those, etcetera.  I'm not jealous when it comes to intellectual property, I just want to be sure of my own ability to use the image freely.  (And as with all my works, anyone else will be welcome to make use of the characters or world, including in stories that they sell for money, etcetera.)

+

By the way, does "Kazehaa Yuuki" mean anything unfortunate in Japanese?

And do I have any Japanese readers who'd be interested in trying to get this translated and published in Japan?

And yes, I'd want that even without Sad Puppies issues.  The Hugo belongs to whoever can rightfully move the souls of Worldcon attendees and accustomed Supporters, not to who can bring in their own people from outside.  Though if anyone wants to go attend Worldcon in person, I'm pretty sure that's fair game and counts as my bringing new blood into Fandom rather than anything icky.

Perpetual Light doesn't break the world, I agree, but in fact limelights were a pretty big deal *during* the industrial revolution - if you can run a factory with valuable machinery at night, you've multiplied the value of the capital equipment in it by a factor of two.

What you're missing is that absent something like CO2, heat radiation rapidly scales with temperature, so that higher energy input creates a new equilibrium that's only very very slightly higher.  It doesn't matter whether you run a thousand nuclear power plants for 10 years or 10,000,000 years, the temperature rises infinitesimally and then stays there.

&gt; If it was easy enough to create e.g. grey goo that can unilaterally outcompete all other life, nature would have already happened onto the formula and we wouldn't be here.

(The reason why molecular-nanotech grey goo doesn't happen accidentally is that proteins, which must be evolvable out of other proteins by mistake, are held together by weak van der Waals forces rather than covalent bonds.  This is why steel and diamond are so much stronger than bone, but don't get used in the body.  Nanotech grey goo is to bacteria what diamond is to flesh.  But your logic holds for grey goo that was made from amino-acid-chain folding proteins.)

Another way of looking at this is that the oracle only provides evidence with 0.6:0.4 likelihood ratios.  You ask "Is my spouse cheating on me?" and the answer is yes, but you were only 1.5 times as likely to get that question in cheating scenarios than in non-cheating scenarios, so if your prior was lower than 40% it should still be under 50% after hearing the new evidence.  It seems like society could survive that, especially since people would know many many cases of divinations being wrong - they might even have started to grasp the concept of prior odds.

Now there's an interesting question.  Is there anything world-breaking you could do in a world (that's already adapted to the magic, not our world, so no stock market shenanigans) where divination spells can only be asked binary questions, are 60% accurate, and multiple castings by different people with related questions make correlated errors?

"I have seen it!"  The man's voice cracked in the midst of the street.  "I have seen the future, and it bears horrors beyond imagining!  Beyond comprehension!"

One or two bypassers had stopped, looking interested at the new madman the city of Boston had gained; for he was respectably suited and bow-tied, with clean garments and polished shoes, nor did he bear the marks of any obvious ministry.  A novelty, then, one that probably wouldn't last.

"Turn back!  We must turn back!  Turn back, I say, before it passes too late!"

"What horrors have you seen?" called a young man, tall and burly enough to have no fear of the man who shouted.

"I cannot, I cannot find the words for you - I saw, I understood, but I cannot speak of it in mortal tongue -"

"Cheap," the burly teen observed, and turned aside as though to go.

The shouting man opened his lips several times, as if in desperate reach of words.  "I've seen..."  He stopped again.  "I've seen a world... *covered in molasses!*"

One of the other bystanders chuckled.  "Ho, that's original for an apocalypse.  An accident at the molasses factory, eh?  You won't find that in the Book of Revelations."

"A world where nothing can be done for the first time!"  The shouting man's voice rose further.  "A world where," his voice cracked, "*being a hairdresser requires a license and two years' college!*"

"What?" said the burly young man, and the others simply looked puzzled.

"A world where the inventors' corporations spend more on patent disputes than on research!  A world where welfare assistance programs start to phase out their benefits so early as to create implicit marginal tax rates nearing a hundred percent, locking people into poverty!"

A woman crossed herself.  "What in Heaven's name is the man saying?"

"Dam'med if I know," her husband said; and she elbowed him in the ribs.  "I s'pose there's a horror in an Armageddon that doesn't make sense."

As though his sanity had cracked and words spilled out through it, the wild-eyed man was now shouting one incomprehensible sentence after another.  "A world where a new medicine costs one billion dollars to test, 'ere it may be sold to even the most desperate!  A world where they pour their life-blood by the trillions into student loans, unwitting that the positional competition for prestige means the supply curve slopes but slightly upward with the price!  And the rent, the rent, the rent is too damned high, for all the committees to be vaulted 'ere anyone can build a house!"

"Speaking in tongues?" an elderly woman whispered.

"A world where Republicans and Democrats alike are steeped in corruption, and voters go to the polls only for fear of the other party! Where first-past-the-post polling prevents any third party from beginning, for each individual voter is impelled to vote for one of the two larger parties by the belief that no third party can yet win!  And with the government so locked in place, there is no help to be had for a tax system grown larger than a mortal could read in a hundred lifetimes!  Coal burns to darken the skies and scorch the land, yet none can rebuild the liquid fluoride thorium reactors that were made fifty years agone; for the molasses, the molasses, the molasses has covered all!"

"I wonder who he was talking to," the elderly woman said, "before he went mad; perhaps it was a lawyer, for I've heard some of those words in the debates."

By now, at last, the white covered carriage of the asylum had arrived, and white-coated muscular men spilled forth to take the doomsayer in hand.  He did not try to run, but submitted as though paralyzed, as though knowing it was all too late.

"Turn back!" he screamed, as they dragged him away.  "Turn back, before there's none left who can even understand the problems!  *Turn back!*"

&gt; "Incredible," said the Dark Lord, in the voice of the Defense Professor that Harry had known. "Fixed, it is fixed in form! A mere construct sustained by magic, become the true substance at the Stone's touch!"

The Apokatastethi ritual produces a construct form, requiring continuous magic to sustain.  We don't know exactly what the canon ritual does, but Dumbledore at least thought that the results would be inferior to the Philosopher's Stone version.  I model the canon ritual as being Voldemort's backup plan, but he had no reason *not* to try the Stone version first.

There's a BIG difference between living for a googolplex years and living Graham's Number years and living infinity years.  Going past a googolplex without repeating yourself requires more than being able to move from one universe to another, it requires that you be able to make causally contiguous physical systems that are vastly larger than a Hubble volume.  If Banks explicitly implied full immortality or even Grahamortality, it wasn't in the admittedly few Culture books I read.

Also, god I hate the whole "Subliming" thing.  If you didn't realize intelligence explosions were a thing when you were creating your universe, and Banks clearly didn't, then you should just go on pretending they're not a thing, not horribly graft them onto your universe and mutilate the universe in the process.  Like lightspeed limits, intelligence explosions are just one of those things you're allowed to ignore by convention in science fiction.

There's no requirement that the work have been published earlier, just that it have been created earlier?  Well, I do have...

Actually, on second thought, nevermind.  The FAI from that story didn't have the ability to supply humanity with literally infinite computing power, and I'm not sure whether the Culture qualifies along these lines (drawing on Grid energies inside this universe might not get you to the Graham's Number level of emortality as Permutation City would allow).  There should be some mix of FAI and emortality that you can get with the *right* right story.

My favorite gotcha along these lines was a Larry Niven story in which the characters discover a time accelerator - time inside the field speeds up by orders of magnitude.  Later they find out that the inventor didn't mean it as a time accelerator, he meant it as an inertia-reducing drive for space travel purposes.  It wasn't until years later that I thought back to the story and realized the link - I don't think it was ever spelled out in the story.

To be clear, I wasn't criticizing Wildbow.  The original Worm does what it sets out to do as well as any story possibly could - it's trying (successfully) to be the Superhero Story To End All Superhero Stories, the category killer for its category, that doesn't let you ever look at superhero stories the same way again; the same thing I set out to do with HPMOR and Harry Potter fanfiction.  Wildbow is rationalizing and therefore of necessity *preserving* every aspect of traditional superhero stories, including Reed Richards Is Useless, excusing them and lawfulizing them as hard as he possibly can (and no harder).  Even so the power balance in Worm is ludicrous but there's no way a human-level author could possibly avert that, given that they were trying to rationalize something akin to the Marvel or DC multiverse to start with; you just can't have economic balance or the weakest inexploitability given that many different superhero-level powers.  Wildbow has thrown on at least four layers of inhibitors to try to rationalize why his Earth goes on spinning despite that, and that's the most he can possibly do without changing the nature of his universe.

What makes the voices start shrieking in my head is when I read a fanfic that's unaware of this, and depicts happy cheerful sane Amy not taking over the world (nor being attacked by the Simurgh or blocked by Contessa).

Depending how similar Clippy's psychology is to my own, and to what extent we're both buffered against the obvious possible ill effects of a speedup, I think we both boost a lot and split the universe between our utility functions.

I feel like a core problem of magic-as-programming is that it feels impossible to set real limits or make the effects of those laws predictable to the reader.  This is true of any mechanical theory of magic - any attempt to postulate an underlying set of mechanical laws by which magical forces interact.  They all seem to run into the same problem in my mind, namely that it would take an *enormous* amount of work to be at all realistic about what sort of spells could or would be built out of low-level lawful blocks.

That's why Brian Sanderson has exactly 14(?) kinds of magic you can use in Mistborn, each operating on clearly defined laws and most of them not industrially useful.  Rather than, say, Sanderson giving a set of cellular-automaton rules you can use to craft spells.  In theory, the latter system could be simpler and more lawful.  In practice it's impossible for any of us to imagine what even a small society of magical researchers working for a few decades, would be able to craft using a magical cellular automaton.  All we can do on our own is the first month of one person's research inside that magical system.  So if the author alleges to you that magic has a programming language or any other mechanical set of interactions at the bottom, in literary practice you're left with a batch of spells that the author has just ruled into existence.  There's no license for the reader to assume that anything they can think of doing with the automaton rules will thereby be doable in the story.

This is why Sam Hughes's Ra never spells out the programming language.  It's why Rick Cook's Wizardry series never spells out the programming language.  One author can't actually go from the low level to the high level - all they can do are tell you, "Here are the final spells."  Does a magical researcher discover a way of combining the features of two spells?  That insight had better not be a critical plot puzzle, because there was no way for the reader to guess that would be allowed.

Mistborn's magic is more suited to Fair Play Insight puzzles, because we know the characters aren't going to invent a new metal that acts like a combination of Pewter and Iron or whatever.  A smart character can burn both Iron and Pewter at the same time and use a clever combination of effects, but the library of spell effects is strictly limited and packaged into solid blocks, thus presenting a fair puzzle in terms of what you can do by combining those effects.

One of the fictional setups I'm considering has magical races where each magical species can produce a small set of effects operating according to strict explicit rules.  In this setup, there are no half-breeds.  There are no ways to produce new magical species.  There's a finite list of magical effects, and a human reader can know all of the rules governing them.  We can call this "Mistbornlike magic."  It doesn't require that magic be mechanical or mundane in its effects - some of the magic can revolve around thought and emotion.  What it requires is that the library of magical effects be short enough for humans to read.

My secret model of how it works in HPMOR is that there are countless objective spellword-gesture combinations and a magically driven intuition for seeking them out, and people find what they're looking for in parts of the magical space resembling their own mental language.  Since the possible incantation-gesture combinations are universal, a single person whose mind sought out the "Mobilicorpus" incantation can tell others about it too regardless of native language.

&gt; If there's any basis whatsoever to this notion of "continuity of consciousness"—**I haven't quite given up on it yet, because I don't have anything better to cling to**—then I would guess that this is how it works.

I don't know how I can make it any plainer; I haven't given up on continuity of consciousness because I don't yet feel like I have a full dissolution that works without it.  Other people claim they do and that they're satisfied; I don't know if I'm missing something they know, or if they're just worse than me at spotting wordless dangling loose ends.  Though frankly my priors are toward the latter.  Real dissolutions should be both explicable and complete.

The thing I was tentatively suggesting might embed continuity of consciousness was Pearl-style causal relations, because material persistence obviously can't do it, because there is no such thing.

Quirrell carried out "I will grant three wishes using a single plot" as follows:

- Harry's wish to remove the Snitch from Quidditch (not a done deal, but Harry gets his chance).
- Either Slytherin or Ravenclaw gets the House Cup (1 wish granted either way).
- Quirrell gets a very long distraction in which to obtain his own wish of getting the Philosopher's Stone.

This was my visualization as well - that the central loop shrinking wouldn't put tension on Harry's wand, just tension pulling back the front death eaters and tension pulling forward the back death eaters; but not put tension on the wand itself, which was loosely connected to the central loop by what was still spider silk.

Minerva doesn't know that Harry is already under the effects of a sleep-altering potion, so she can't just give him an antidote.  And yes, I was assuming that there were potions to lengthen sleep cycles but not contract them (which I think is realistic, that getting less sleep is Messing With Brains to a greater extent than staying awake longer and then getting more sleep).

Only very privileged people like me, and possibly you, could even consider trying to go through their life not lying to people.  Not least because the world is full of tacit lies that fall just short of common knowledge, like politician's promises that even their 'duped' voters wouldn't bet money on being carried out, and refusal to participate in those carries all sorts of social penalties.  If you don't create your own truthful community from scratch or go around speaking exclusively to science fiction fans or particular rare kinds of academics, then the price of not lying is being excluded as an alien from most ordinary social groups.  I can get away with that, but I'm aware of how privileged I am in getting away with it, and I'm not about to look down on others who aren't as fortunate.

At the same time, everything in the Contagious Lies principle is also true in the real world, and the world is indeed full of nonaccidentally terrible epistemology invented in the course of defending lies.  So if you've successfully carved out a place for pursuing truth, then it's pretty important to avoid defending lies there, as a special case within your society.  It's also important to universally avoid defending lies inside your own mind.

It's why Harry does tell as much of the truth as he does to Moody, Bones, and McGonagall immediately, and I wouldn't bet on him concealing the Azkaban jaunt from Bones and Moody all that much longer, though he probably does want to build up at least a bit of a working relationship first.  That is Harry being *unusually truthful* for a person in his position, in order to fend off collisions and catastrophes later, even though he's no longer trying to speak perfect truth all the time.

"The danger of the unexplored" is not meant to be a primary theme of HPMOR, and it's certainly not a primary thing that Rationality is about.

Sure, dangerous unexplored things put high strains on rationalist skillz because evidence about them is very expensive so you have to reason clearly using small amounts of evidence.  But that's not a primary theme of HPMOR.

So the current scene indeed doesn't do this very well, but what I *want* to communicate is surprise, alarm, and the fact that three seconds earlier he thought the universe was a tightly wowen weave where just randomly tossing in a Conservation of Energy violation would blow all the low-level rules to shit, so it's a lot more alarming than seeing a helium balloon floating when you previously thought objects fell downward or any other violation of mere surface rules in a world-model composed only of surface rules.

It's changing the total energy of the universe, not of a subsystem, that I'd expect to break things (obviously changing the subsystem's energy shouldn't break anything, that happens all the time).  Unless there's a simple way to demonstrate that if something doesn't break a subsystem, it doesn't break a supersystem?  Without quoting anyone, based on discussions so far, one of the physicists I've consulted thought that violating Conservation of Energy would blast quantum mechanics to crap to the point where it was hard to consider the counterfactual - which indeed is the sentiment that I was originally trying to have Harry convey, and if it doesn't produce NP-hard problem-solving I'll try to find some other expression of alarm that communicates how hard everything just broke.

I'm currently checking with Scott Aaronson to see if he agrees that having a free choice to change the total energy of the universe that you can make conditional on e.g. a register in a quantum computer makes stuff break.  The basic idea here is that your quantum computer has an instruction VIOLE that you can conditionally execute which increases the total energy of the universe by 1 electron volt for ~21 femtoseconds and then drops it back to baseline, thereby rotating the amplitude of that branch by a phase factor of -1 relative to its prior phase relative to all the branches that don't execute VIOLE.  It seems to me that this should blow everything up and not only allow solving NP-hard problems but also allow FTL signalling and worse, but like I said, at this point I'm checking with an expert.

I suppose you could say more precisely that the unitarity problem lies with the conditional change of total energy rather than the change of total energy; throwing extra particles into all the quantum branches simultaneously wouldn't violate unitarity, for example.  But assuming that McGonagall is allowed to choose whether to turn into a cat based on a quantum coinflip, 'conditional change of total energy' is exactly what Harry is seeing.

That doesn't really address the point.

I've done the slightly less easy thing, and fired off a query to Scott Aaronson to check that what Harry says in Ch.2 is valid reasoning within the standard and mainstream theory of quantum computation plus Harry Potter magic.

Elsewhere in this thread, I've said that, yes, Harry is right in Ch. 2, optionally violating Energy conservation to a controlled quantitative degree after a decision point implies controllable FTL signalling if you can do it inside a coherent quantum state, so anyone who takes this admittedly exotic physical point, pretends to authority as a physicist, and acts like I am just making it up, is committing an extremely grave sin of public deception regarding science.  Basically, "I am a physicist and I can tell you what Eliezer Yudkowsky said is something you should pay no attention to, he's just some amateur making stuff up about quantum physics that isn't true" but this critique isn't in fact true, and for Su3 to make public claims thereof on his pretended authority puts him way outside the pale regardless of what mixture of dishonesty, convenient self-deception, and sheer unchecked ignorance was responsible for it.  It's part of a worldview of "Eliezer Yudkowsky is this random Internet person who doesn't really know anything" that is kinda, you know, blatantly false, but this is the gestalt that the sneertrolls have settled upon for their status-superiority fantasies.

Next in Su3's litany and first in alexanderwales's list, we have a complaint that applying the Bystander Effect to countries is improper.  I call bull on two grounds.  First, countries are made of individuals and McGonagall is said to specifically have told Harry that 'everyone was hoping for someone else to do something'.  Second, I'm not familiar with any formulation of Bystander Apathy that says, "Please don't apply this to people told they have been divided into multiple groups, there's a different law that we've found to govern people who consider themselves parts of multiple groups and it has a different name."

Both of these things being true, it simply isn't a science error to have Harry being told that everyone hoped someone else would act, and for Harry to think of Latane-and-Darley as a known bit of science that potentially contributes to describing and understanding that situation.

The rest proceeds similarly - Su3 either committing factual errors as in the critique of Harry's quantum physics, or Su3 tremendously overstretching what he wants to call bad science.

An exception is that Harry is indeed sorta-wrong about whether Novikov-consistent time travel is Turing-computable.  Harry is wrong in the sense that the outcomes for finite digital self-consistent universes can be calculated and his surroundings can probably be approximated by that to arbitrary precision if they are otherwise computable, despite the presence of added time-travel; Harry is right in the sense that the way in which it's calculated is alien to ordinary Turing machines which proceed causally, that the time travel violates any straight mapping of his universe onto a normal Turing machine with different rules.  Since [I wrote a whole blog post explaining the fine details there](http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/), I'm obviously not unaware of them.

But Harry is right to look at that result and conclude that he hasn't been Matrixed by anything that is running on any sort of computer that is anything like the computers in our universe.  Finding yourself able to travel using a Time-Turner and experiencing that as self-consistent is pretty strong evidence against putative Matrix Lords using computers like the computers we know.

I should probably add a disclaimer to Ch. 15 about that part, though, because (as I hadn't worked out in sufficient detail at the time of originally writing Ch. 14) there is in fact a way to compute the permissible final results of time travel within an otherwise computable universe, using an exponentially larger computer.

GaussTheSane said that there was *maybe possibly* a way to lose conservation of energy while preserving unitarity.  He didn't present one, and it's actually pretty hard for me to see how you can have an optional choice to change the universe's total energy in a quantum computer in only some branches of a quantum computation and *not* end up with unitarity violation, quantum NP solvers, FTL signalling and all the rest.  Saying "Well, *maybe* there'd be some exotic way to avert that" is hardly the same as saying that Harry's reaction is scientifically incorrect.

Sigh.  Maybe I can get Scott Aaronson to explain on Shtetl-Optimized why a woman who seems to have an option to change her energy in a non-conserved way would imply quantum NP solvers if she was part of a coherent quantum computer and could do that act in only some branches of the quantum computation.  FTL signalling proceeds similarly.

The fact that Su3 claimed that what I said had no scientific basis, while also claiming to be a physicist, is the point where I decided I wasn't going to read through the rest.  I mean, I can imagine that Su3 took physics but doesn't understand quantum computing or unitarity well enough to understand why an energy-changing option implies P=NP and the rest, but that still utterly fails to impress me because Su3 should have asked a better physicist to explain my reasoning to him before trumpeting his fake error.

If some physicist who does understand quantum computation, objects to the idea that a free option of changing or not changing the total energy of the universe corresponds to quantum computers solving NP-hard problems in polynomial time or similarly regarding FTL signalling, I'll listen, but I don't expect that to happen.  The whole difficulty of quantum computation is the difficulty of getting non-solutions to cancel out inside the wave function, and if branches can change their total energy they can easily make themselves cancel out.

(I did not make the request because I intended to commit my time to a long Internet war rebutting everything su3 said at any point in the past or future.  I made the request so I could quickly read through and check if someone had found an actual error I needed to correct.)

That's why I did post a thread asking if anyone had found a correct critique mixed into all the bull.  I wasn't about to wade through it myself, but that didn't rule out the possibility that there was a nugget of gold in the manure.  I didn't get any good suggestions, besides one person turning up with an unrelated error.

Internet sneertroll criticism is usually just *bad*.  You should not strongly expect to find a nugget of gold any more than you should expect a creationist yelling at a biologist to have found at least one real problem with all that effort.

You're forgetting that a large number of other readers (including a fair number of physicists or physics students) already didn't report those alleged errors.  Su3 isn't the first person to look, or the thousandth.  The population as a whole finds new things, but not him.  In that situation where finding a true error is hard, someone manufacturing fake errors won't report even a single real one.

Ask people on the street if you've identified their names correctly.  If they say yes, I don't think most psychotics hallucinate that hard.  So your brain is exceptionally and unusually insane enough to prevent any error detection and cause all senory experiences to conform.  At that point you might as well expect future sensory experiences to go the same way.

I requested any real examples anyone could find, in the thread alexander referenced, and got one actual science error contributed (that I need to fix at some point) that of course wasn't actually from su3su2su1 but just from an interested bystander.

Why would you expect someone building an online reputation on sneering to go the trouble of scanning a thoroughly scanned work until they found a new science error that had passed me and all previous readers when they could just force a few strained interpretations into fake errors?  It's not like his primary readership cares so long as somebody gets a new good hit in on that Big Yud guy they've all come together to hate.

I've made a number of science errors over the course of my life, and had them pointed out to me - but I don't think ever even once by the people of the sneer.

Finding a real error takes work, careful reading, double checking to make sure this is really actually an error and that the author didn't already correct it in a later edition.  I'm proud to this day that I found an error of a higher level than typo in the second edition of Judea Pearl's Causality (which Pearl fixed in the next edition) because it demonstrates that there's one section there that I read through and visualized more carefully than anyone else with a propensity to send in errors.  And you'd better believe I triple checked that apparent problem before emailing Pearl, and even then it turned out my suggested solution still wasn't right.

/r/HPMOR as a whole has a respectable power to find errors sometime, though minor continuity blips are far more common than science errors.  But the thought that su3su2su1 could just walk through finding errors in every chapter is laughable, and since he's clearly making up most of it, you shouldn't be surprised that he's making up all of it.  If somebody started posting a list of science errors by Scott Aaronson or Scott Alexander purporting to find errors in every post, I wouldn't expect to find even a single real one mixed in.

So far as I know, DLP is a troll site pretending to be HP fanfiction critics.  The thread I saw contained boasts from someone about how they lure authors into chatrooms by seeming to offer constructive criticisms and then try to make the fresh meat break down and cry.  I've heard claims that there are threads there that aren't just trying to provoke, but haven't seen any, and certainly I've never seen any good writing resources from them or ever seen somebody link an insightful analysis there.

The array of ice ninjas spread out before me, dark and icy.  With my hit points this low and a Slow status effect, there was no way I could defeat them by any mundane means.

It was time to unleash my ultimate technique.

*"I am the bone of my sword,"* I chanted. *"In life's name, and for life's sake, just who the hell do you think I am -"*

But even as my Reality Marble began to spread around me, there was a ripping sound like a thousand needles piercing each other.  A hole in space, a tear in time, a gateway to Something Else, and [three dozen people piling out of it](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover).

"Oooookay," said a bemused-looking woman at the vanguard, as she looked up at the giant red roses turning like gears in the sky, then the ice ninjas facing us as they began to unsling their icy weapons of ice.  "Shea, you're sure we're safe here, right?"

A man with a rapier slung over his shoulder shrugged.  "Meh."

"*Meh?*  What do you mean, *meh?*"

The rest of the three dozen people who'd piled out of the rip were starting to materialize weapons in their hand, flare fire from their hands, or were just staring menacingly at the ice ninjas in a way that was causing some of them to spontaneously combust.

I'll tell you how disturbed I was.  I was so disturbed I actually blinked.

And I... *miiight* have lost a bit of mental control over my Reality Marble, Unlimited Crossover Works.

There was another horrible tearing sound in reality and I tried to recompose my mind, but it was already much too late.

More rips in reality opened.  Rips, plural.

[A grim-faced woman holding what looked like a giant spatula](http://www.bladeandepsilon.com/hybridtheory.htm), followed by several hulking warriors, a woman made out of water, and a girl in a short skirt glowing white like a goddess -

A [14-year-old boy whose eyes glowed with infinite depth and starlight](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4320933/1/The-Open-Door), followed by three girls and somehow, in the distance behind him, an enormous spaceship that looked like it was covered with gargoyles, *damned* gargoyles suffering in hell -

[A twelve-year-old boy in a business suit followed by an entourage of more than forty girls dressed in various costumes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6228161/1/Unequally-Rational-and-Emotional) -

"No, seriously, *where the hell did you insert us?*" shrieked the woman who'd spoken before, again at that man with the rapier slung over his shoulder.

The man shrugged.  "I told Maria's program to look for a Crossroads, someplace we could get easy access to a large number of other metaverses..."  He cast an experienced, jaded-looking eye over all the rips opening up in my Reality Marble.  "I think it might've put us in a *place and time* instead of a *place*, though.  This looks more like an Infinite Crisis than a Crossroads."  He shrugged again.  "Good thing we're here to sort it out, eh?"

There was a slow, awful pause as the armies of newcomers stared at the group of travelers at the center of it all.

And then, inevitably, with an awful grace like the fall of a falling tower, all hell began to break loose.

 Robertson was just sitting there with his hands over his eyes, refusing to look at what the screens were showing.

Everything up until Gutenberg... up until a few decades *before* Gutenberg... all of that had been fine.  All of that had made sense.  Maybe it didn't match exactly what was in the history books, but you could *recognize the planet* you were looking at.

Now we'd gone past the printing press, and we were discovering that all the parchments from before that time, those *handwritten* and *hand-copied* parchments that later souls had put to print and recorded, were just about as accurate as the Song of Beowulf or anything else that had been spoken and repeated in words.  Why had we ever trusted in things just because they'd been written down?  Why had we thought words would be more stable than songs if they were hand-copied instead of mouth-repeated?

"We can't publish this," Sonia said, staring in at the new pictures on screen, what they'd been doing in the Vatican and churches around the country in 1122.  "There would be a war.  Literally actually a war.  There's more than a billion Catholics in the world and this, this -"  Sonia just gestured at the screen, which was providing irrefutable and highly pornographic proof that Catholicism didn't just have BDSM tendencies, it had *been* BDSM.

Eskimos had briefly governed half the planet, including the Americas, during the 1200s.

The idea of wearing clothes that covered your genitals had been invented for the first time in 1171.

"One more century," I said.  "All we have to do is look at one more century."

We all gathered around the monitors to stare, and the first photos from 1020 AD started to roll in.

We saw the mighty works that the Aztects had been building, clearly visible from space even without zooming in.

The first masonry construct looked from space like an English N.

The next one looked from space like an English E...

"This is impossible," whispered Sonia as we watched the letters forming, glimpses of tiny workers swarming over them with stones in hand to form a giant V.

Below my hotel room balcony, the streets of Las Vegas glow like jewels, colored necklaces and bracelets adorning the cities of humanity.  A pyramid, a giant animal statue, all lit up in neon lights.  Gaudy, pointless things.  The perfect background to the end of my pointless life.

I finish typing my suicide letter into my hand tablet.  It's a short letter.  I thumbed it into a tablet on purpose, to avoid the temptation of making it longer.  All there's left to do now is hit Send, and jump.

There's a knock on the hotel room door and I whirl, dropping my tablet in shock.  *There's nobody there.*

The knock comes again, and still there's nobody there.

Then the door opens without my having unlocked it, and an empty woman in a business suit walks in.  She's short, carries herself like a martial artist, her face is pretty enough to be the work of a plastic surgeon, and she doesn't have a trace of fat on her chin and *there's nobody there*.

"Please don't be alarmed that you can't read my mind," she says, voice soft.  "I'm not a zombie, I just have a mind shield implanted under my skull.  I'm here on behalf of the Ordinator."

My shoulders slump.  That's the name of a famous East Coast supervillain, one of the dark-genius types - no psionic powers, just intelligence and the willingness to violate civilization's codes.  If this was some other time, I'd be... fighting his minion?  It'd be a very short fight with her wearing a mind shield, if she has any weapons at all on her.  "Did I hit one of the Ordinator's casinos by accident?" I said.  "If so, I'm sorry."  I'd made very sure not to hit anywhere clean, when I was picking up the money for my farewell bender.  Hitting up dirty casinos carries its own risks, but I hadn't thought they'd catch up with me this fast...  This is such a crazy pointless inconvenience along the way to my death.

The woman in the business suit shakes her head.  "The Ordinator sent me to try to talk you out of committing suicide."

I just look at her.  Her body.  I can't read her mind.  I don't really know how to deal with people whose minds I can't read.  I can't tell if she's joking.

"We have a program monitoring the personal computers of all the superheroes we've managed to hack," the woman says, I think in what's supposed to be an apologetic tone.  "Entering your suicide note triggered one of our alarms."

"The Ordinator runs a suicide prevention program for superheroes?  Since he's tapping our phones anyway?"  I... ought to be laughing?  Chuckling?  I don't know.  I can see that it's funny, but I can't *feel* the humor.

The woman in the business suit walks into my room without asking permission, moves past me to stand also by the balcony.  "Not exactly," the woman says, still quietly.  "You know, I was standing in a hotel room very much like this room, about five years ago.  I didn't look like this then.  I was fat, and overweight, and disgusting, and depressed, and majoring in psychology, and nobody wanted me and nobody ever would.  I maxed out my last credit card just to get the hotel room..."  She looks down from the balcony, gazing below in almost exactly the way that I had, then turns her head back to look at me.  "You know, our civilization actually does have the science and technology to fix everything that was wrong with me?  If you ignore patents and medical ethics and do your own research in ways that aren't socially acceptable - the Ordinator pays his test subjects, don't get me wrong, but they're poor and need the money and our society tends to frown on making that bargain.  The Ordinator said there was maybe a 50-50 chance of at least one of the enhancement-package interventions killing me, or putting me into bad enough shape that I'd want to finish my suicide."  The woman shrugs.  "I spent a few months in the Ordinator's private medical clinic in Thailand, which also gave me an explosive implant in my skull to ensure my loyalty.  And I'm healthy, and thin, and not depressed any more, and I can run and jump and even do flying sidekicks.  I'm... happy, now.  Not just happier than I would be dead.  *Happy.*"

My voice is sick as it comes from my throat.  "So this is a recruiting call, then."

The woman nods.  She's still on the hotel room's balcony, ready to stop me if I try to jump.  I look back at the door and see that she's slapped some sort of device over the lock.

"Why did you want to die?" the woman said softly.  "Is there any way we can help?"

"We need to talk," I said calmly.  "We *all* need to talk.  This isn't working out."

Marlowe didn't answer, since he was still firing his gun through the broken remains of the kitchen window at the oncoming horde of zombies, but he did briefly look in my direction and nod.

Lindsianni continued to drink from her crimson smoothie, the angry blush coming over her pale cheeks not quite belying her undead status.

As usual, it was left to Andy to react.  "You're leaving me?" she shrieked.  "Leaving *us?*  After all we've been through together?"

"Damn it, Lindsi!" bellowed Marlowe, hurling a grenade out the window, where it promptly blew up one of the rosebushes on the front lawn and spattered everything nearby with burning zombie goop.  "Use that unholy strength of yours for something besides sipping drinks!"

Lindsi just sniffed.

"Why?" screamed Andy, wringing her hands.  "Why does everything always have to be so dramatic with you?"

"I'm grateful for everything you've done for me," I said.  "I'm grateful that you saved me from the werewolves, I'm grateful for you sheltering me through all these months, and the sex was a lot of fun, but honestly, I'm starting to think there are some life problems that just *can't* be solved with polyamory."

Lindsi spit out her red smoothie, Marlowe dropped his gun, and Andy fainted.

I think that's people Munchkining sexual superpowers, not failing to Solve By Polyamory problems that can be Solved By Polyamory and otherwise being Dangerously Genre Savvy, and solid aliens that look interesting to human sexual fetishes.

This is pretty high on the list of things I'd want to publish but only after putting some conceptual distance between myself and any organizations that need to look normal.

Can I combine it with an equal quantity of antimatter... no, OP says "nothing but" a grape.  If I use a freezer to freeze the grape, does that count as not using nothing but a grape?  If I accelerate the frozen grape to a deadly velocity, does that break the rule?  If so, how can anything count as killing someone using nothing but the grape when I'm adding *myself* to the mix?

If Hutter's not talking about tiling agents / Vingean reflection, then I'm not sure what he could have originally said to the reporter, but my guess is he's talking about that, unless Hutter considers Schmidhuber's paper on Godel machines to qualify as a proof of that (I sure wouldn't call that "a mathematical theory proves that...")

So far as I know, what has been shown so far is that, given some generous assumptions, a certain kind of expected utility agent will approve creating another agent with the same utility function.

Mathematical proofs should always follow with necessity from their stated assumptions, with no additional assumptions being required.  What if Omega is watching you and threatening to destroy everything you care for unless you add one tiny codicil to your utility function about there existing at least one paperclip?  Well, actually in this case you should ignore Omega because no-blackmail equilibrium.  But suppose Omega is offering you a trillion galaxies' worth of resources if you modify your utility function to consider the preservation of at least one paperclip to be a terminal value; in that case, you should modify yourself accordingly.

Since math is about conclusions which follow with necessity from premises, any theorem you prove about agents building similar agents or stably self-modifying should include an assumption which says that the above doesn't happen.  In our most recent work this appears under the rubric of what we've been calling the "no-Newcomb condition" (not sure if we have anything published on this).  Nothing like that is explicitly stated in Schmidhuber's Godel-machines paper, so if Hutter thinks a real theorem could have been proven there showing tiling stability, that would be a mistake.  It's plausible that Hutter was referring to MIRI's tiling-agents work, though.

But ultimately, you can't judge any scientist by what a reporter says they said.  There's no way of knowing what the scientist really said, or tried to say, or repeatedly rephrased until the reporter got something they wanted, etcetera.

Don't know of a better starting point than https://intelligence.org/files/TilingAgentsDraft.pdf

Well, it's not in the text, so your headcanon is as good as my headcanon.  Though if any of the like, 3 people who worked out that Pettigrew was a Metamorphmagus had brought forth "But then the surprise of Sirius having a brief tragic sexual affair with Pettigrew is lessened" as evidence, it would be a literary fact.

You're reversing the literary causality.

Every true HP fanfiction must contain at least one completely wrong ship.

Mine was Sirius/Pettigrew.

This then asks other questions about the local world like "How unusual was that exactly?" and "How will people un this world react to that?", which the opening section answers in advance.

FYI: Headcanon of God: Pettigrew was Metamorphosed into a woman while they were having sex.

There is indeed one critical location, as the Mendelian pattern shows pretty strongly - from a Bayesian perspective, it's significantly more likely to show up if there's a single critical location, and that's by far the simplest explanation for what shows up.  Harry thought the Squibs were being caused by witches Imperiusing Muggles and sleeping with them.  The possibility Harry didn't think of is this: there isn't a "wizard gene", there's a Muggle gene.  Damaged Muggle genes create wizards; sometimes two wizards mate and one of the damaged Muggle genes ends up repaired via chromosomal crossover.  Since recent Muggleborns tend to have less damaged Muggle genes compared to old wizard families, the chromosomal repair is much more likely to happen among wizarding lines which recently accepted Muggleborns into their ancestry.

I didn't find any good way to work this into the story before the end, unfortunately.

*I can do this.*

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to not grow up having the nightmares.  Every night for as far back as my memory goes at all.  People gnawing on each other like starving dogs, sometimes because they're zombies, sometimes not.  In my dreams I've looked up at the sky and seen mushroom clouds, firestorms, descending asteroids, alien fleets, the unpiloted drone armies of the Earth gone mad with software error.

*No, fuck you.  Shut up.  I can do this.*

And in the worst dreams of all, the light in the sky just starts fading one hour, so subtly that you wouldn't notice at first, and then, during the last doubling, going entirely black.  The sky stays black for 43 minutes, and then there's a fire that rends the Earth.

That's the dream that always stays after I've eliminated everything else, every other timeline, the End After the End, the one that gets me even if I can manage to push every other problem out past somewhere around 2040.  Sometimes a few years earlier or later, but never long.  If everything else can be put off, if life on Earth stays peaceful, the daylight fades and the sky goes black.

Well, fuck that.  If you can see it, you can change it, that's my motto.  When I was nine years old, the day I understood that the nightmares were real *and* that nobody else in the world had them, I decided - no, not decided, I just automatically went there, I dedicated my life to making sure that humanity survived.  What you can see, you can change.  I invented ways to practice my abilities, I practiced a dozen forms of meditation, I never went near drugs in case they broke me.  I twisted my brain until I could see *timelines*, until I wasn't just having helpless nightmares but plucking the strands of time and playing them like guitar strings.

Bend time, bend reality, eliminate all the timelines where sane nice intelligent life *doesn't* survive and take *literally whatever* is left over -

I'd been using all my power to that one single end since I was nine years old, and today, on January 19th 2038, it was coming to a head.  All in one day because everything had to balance out *exactly* and the more of it happened at the same time, the easier it was to find something else to cancel it.

"I can do this."  Drops of sweat ran down over my forehead.  "I can fucking do this, just shut up."

A little skeleton girl wearing an ankh around her neck was sitting on my living room couch, laughing too hard to speak.  I get the nightmares in the waking world now, and they're strange, half-alive; pushing my power this far had come with mental side effects, even without drugs.

From outside the window came a distant rumble.  That asteroid had been going to hit the Earth anyway, might as well put it at exactly the right distance to Yellowstone where it would let some of the lava out and prevent the bigger eruption later.

The continuous screaming from outside my window grew in volume and, yes, there were the erupting forces of Hell itself, right on schedule to join the free-for-all with the aliens and the zombies.  The zombies weren't smart enough to work doors and locks, the aliens had gone after the zombies first, the demons would go after the aliens and the Hellish aura they emitted would kill off the bioengineered pandemic virus that had laid up almost all the real human beings in bed.  The demons would die, and the unholy vitality of their blood would mix with alien spores to sprout up crops that would replace humanity's disrupted food chain.

"I can do this!" I yelled. "Fuck you, I can do this!"

The hallucinatory Death was smiling.

The drone armies shrieked across the sky, deploying an endless stream of robotic warriors.

I snarled a high wordless note of triumph as the clock's second hand hit *7* and the 32-bit UNIX clock ticked over and the descending metallic androids powered down and fell out of the sky.

"Fuck you!" I screamed at the silver bodies falling like rain.  I was getting hoarse, but fuck that too.  I was doing it, *I was fucking doing it!*

The Large Hadron Collider powered on for its first test at the new, higher energy (those were some seriously dedicated terrorists in there, the original scientists would never have kept on their posts through the plague) and formed a negatively charged strangelet that plunged into the core of the Earth, where it would give the Devouring Shrub hidden at the center of our world a bellyache that would put it to sleep for another million years.

From the bottom of the ocean, a seething dreaming madness that waited in a lost, submerged alien city awoke, partially because of all the corresponding madness going on upstairs, and partially because I'd deliberately given It a shove on a purely probabilistic level.  I *needed* Cthulhu to awaken and not in a good mood either.  The Higher Horror reflected a bug in the software that ran the Universe, and only that bug could cancel out the disaster when our simulators got perturbed and tried to shut down the simulation.

The pain in my mouth told me that I'd clenched my jaw hard enough to crack a tooth.  I didn't care.  I was mentally balancing the number of nuclear weapons that were being launched, it had to be enough that when the rockets collided with the living cloud eating the upper atmosphere and detonated high instead of low, they'd generate an electromagnetic pulse that fried all the electronics on the ground.

Frying *all* the electronics was the hard one.  The important one.  Today I was only really delaying the True End, not stopping it, today I was just playing for time.  If I didn't get all the electronics, I'd discovered plying the timelines - or if the anti-intellectual crusade was anything less than thorough in how many laboratories it burned - then the next self-improving AI would be born in just twenty years, not the century I was playing for today.

Almost the first thing a self-improving AI does is reach for probability-manipulation powers itself.  My visions say I *can't* win against them once they're born.  They figure out the protein structure prediction problem, build their own nanotechnology, and reach for the most powerful energy source around, the sunlight hitting Earth's atmosphere.  Tiny replicating diamondoid bots, building more of themselves out of the carbon in the atmosphere, eating all the sunlight until there's nothing left for the surface; and then 43 minutes later, it launches the first probes to other stars, an event that incidentally shatters the Earth.  It doesn't kill humanity before then, because it doesn't matter, there's nothing we can do to stop it once it's born.

But I can stop that AI from being born.  All I have to do is fry all the computers.  The resulting peace stretches out beyond my lifespan, beyond my vision, and I can't see how it ends... but I have to believe that if I can just push the development date for AI out far enough, somebody will figure out how to make a *nice* one instead.  But delaying that particular technological development, with so much incentive and so much driving it, takes an apocalypse large enough to kill most of humanity.  Unless, of course, you resort to an equally large event that cancels out some of the first one, and then you've got to consider the side effects of that event too...

The sky flashed white, and the television in front of me died with a crackling sound.  I was panting, on my knees now, blood dripping from my mouth from where I'd bitten through my lip.  But I'd killed the computers, put enough dust in the atmosphere to cancel out global warming, and generated exactly enough nuclear isotopes to feed the incoming Subatomic Life Plague without it having to nibble on the rest of the planet.

Sitting on my living room couch, the hallucinatory personification of Death went on laughing right up until the golden sparkling dust of a Dream Eater seeped through the air and ate her.

The lack of connection to 'material physics' has nothing to do with rationality or lack thereof; give me magic and I'll work with magic.

I agree with you that the work is arational, but that's because none of the mythic characters and few of the mortals have consequentialist desires in the sense of visibly wanting particular future outcomes.  To write rationalfic in the setting, you'd either need to insert a human protagonist that wanted the future to have some particular property, or drastically change the character of one of the mythic characters.

"So it's like... only wanting one thing?" the women sitting across the table from me said slowly.  "Only pursuing one path with your whole life?  That sounds horrifying."  Her expression changed.  "And intriguing," another one of her said slyly.

I've always had trouble memorizing names.  Maybe I could do it if it was just one, but trying to remember which expression corresponds to who and whether it was Sarah or Sally or Samantha - at some point I just gave up and told people my disorder also made me identity-blind.

"That's not exactly it," I said.  "I still want many different things, but all those goals belong to the same *me*."

"But you can only *do* one thing at a time," said yet another iteration of her, maybe Sindy, I don't know.  "So, if the sole you, I mean, if you wanted to eat only pizza, and you *simultaneously* wanted to eat only spaghetti, then even if you say that's not a logical contradiction, well, you could only *do* one or the other."

"That's true of you too," I replied.  "Your body only ends up doing one thing."

"Yes, but whichever one of me *does* it is eating the food she wants!"

I shrugged.  "Yep.  Single Personality Disorder means a lot more sorting through priorities and a lot more disappointment.  On the plus side, I get a lot more time being *me*."

"Oh," she said, her face screwed up.  "Is that why you're so mature, so young... that's a bit sad, really."  Her face suddenly relaxed.  "I ought to have figured that out, honestly - I'm Sam, if you're having trouble keeping track, the intellectual one.  So does your body always get to make the choice *you* like most?  I fantasize about that sometimes, but I know that spending all my money on books wouldn't be healthy."

"You'd think it would be that way," I said a bit sadly, "but it isn't.  More like... I get tired from being *me* so much, without any break.  And when I'm tired... somehow I can't do the things I want most any more, I'm not sure why.  I want to read a physics book, but end up watching TV."

A worried identity stared at me from across the table.  "Please don't be offended, I'm not trying to be multinormative, I'm just trying to understand how it is for you.  But that sounds like there *is* another identity inside you, and they can only come out when you're tired.  Like you're brutally forcing them down all the time, and they can only escape when you're weakened."

I shook my head.  "If so, that other self can't plan, or think, or construct its own beliefs.  My SPD means that anything that can use the deliberative process, anything smart enough to become a voice inside my head, just gets sucked into the black hole of *me* that self-identifies as everything at once.  If I do have a tired identity, it's more like a chimpanzee inside me, not a full human personality.  And that other identity can't take over completely, they can't use their own mental energy to vigorously do just what they want.  When I'm tired I can only do tired things.  What it feels like from the inside is that my fuel for being *me* runs out and then there's no one else to take over.  I can't... lift the weight of doing my most desirable thing any more, but there's nobody else to do their own favorite thing instead, so I just watch TV..." my voice trailed off.  "This is a bit unpleasant for me, can I talk about something else?"

The women nodded.  "I think that does answer some of Sarah's questions about why you don't pursue just one single goal all the time," said whoever was talking.  Her expression shifted, became sly again.  "To talk about a more pleasant subject, I imagine that having just one of you must simplify sexual consent negotiations a lot?"

I nodded slightly.  "It's not *quite* as simple as you're imagining, I can want sex and not want it at the same time... but yes, it's relatively simpler.  If SPD is good for anything, it's consenting to sex with a whole lot less inter-identity dating.  Linear time instead of quadratic.  I still have to get to know all of you, but all of you only need to get to know one of me.  We could finish the process in a few hours, if you really wanted."

I saw the several arrested looks upon her face, and smiled.

The model I was working under was along the lines of:  Okay, you can identify objects in the outside world using your brain's intuitive concept of form.  But if you try atoms - well, there aren't any atoms *and* your brain has a shaky abstract grasp on that.  Quantum fields evolving over time?  Still nothing like that in reality!  But if you think about a factor of an amplitude relation in a timeless configuration space, then despite your brain's shaky grasp on it, it's something that's actually out there and the magic can identify what you're talking about.

The recursion has to stop there, though, because infinite recursions have at most three levels total.

Either 2 or 3.  And book 1 is where Harry &amp; co lose 150 House Points by being out past curfew, and Harry thinks about how they'd just lost for Gryffindor all the points that Harry won by catching the Snitch.  It's pretty obvious that as of those books, the background universe was running on absolute points being added onto the House Points total.  If there was an Author's Saving Throw on this exploit mentioned in the later books, such as only the difference in scores adding on to House Points, a reference would be nice.  (I consider only the original 7 books to be "canon" for purposes of being background to HPMOR.)

Some of it is infidelity with mind-controlled Muggles (or Squibs), which happens rather a lot; but some of it is repair via chromosomal crossover of the magic-suppressing Muggle Gene that wizards carry damaged versions of.  The gene itself is all on or all off at each allele location, but pureblood families that have been casting out their Squibs for centuries are less likely to birth a new Squib than two recent Muggleborns carrying only slightly damaged versions of the magic-suppressing gene.

Yup.  I don't know why so many people took the Atlantean supercomputer as intended canon when Harry promptly listed all the problems with it and basically rejects it and more or less never thinks about that specific hypothesis again.

AI is practically the only major x-risk that *doesn't* make *only* the Earth uninhabitable.  Out-of-control replicating nanotech, engineered pathogens, extreme radioactivity, etc.  The *distinguishing* factor of strong AI as an x-risk is that it will come and get you on Mars, which is the reason why Elon Musk is worried.

Besides your having listed Max Tegmark who coauthored an essay with Hawking on this exact subject, for an authority inside the field see e.g. Prof. Stuart Russell, coauthor of the leading undergraduate AI textbook, for an example of a well-known AI researcher calling attention to the same issue, i.e., that we need to be paying more attention to what happens if AI succeeds.  (I'm actually typing this from Cambridge at a decision theory conference we're both attending, about the problems agents encounter in predicting themselves, which is a subproblem of being able to rigorously reason about self-modification, which is a subproblem of having a solid theory of AI self-improvement.)  Yesterday Russell gave a talk on the AI value alignment problem at Trinity, emphasizing how 'making bridges that don't fall down' is an inherent part of the 'building bridges' problem, just like 'making an agent that optimizes for particular properties' is an inherent part of 'building intelligent agents'.  In turn, Russell is following in the footsteps of much earlier observations by I. J. Good and Ray Solomonoff.

All reputable thinkers in this field are taking great pains to emphasize that AI is not about to happen *right now*, or at least we have no particular grounds to believe this, and Hawking didn't say otherwise.

The analogy Stuart Russell uses for current attitudes toward AI is that aliens email us to announce that They Are Coming and will land in 30-50 years, and our response is "Out of office."  He also uses the analogy of a car that seems to be driving on a straight line toward the edge of a cliff, distant but the car seems to be accelerating, and people saying "Oh, it'll probably run out of gas before then" and "It's okay, the cliff isn't right in front of us yet."

I believe Scott Phoenix may also be in the "Time to start thinking about this, they're coming eventually" group but I cannot speak for him.

Due to the tremendous tendency to conflate the concept of "We think it is time to start research" with "We think advanced AI is arriving tomorrow", people like Tegmark and Phoenix (and myself) have to take pains to emphasize each time we open our mouths that we don't think AI is arriving tomorrow and we know that current AI is not very smart and that we understand current theory doesn't give us a clear path to general AI.  Stuart Russell's talk included a Moore's Law graph with a giant red NO sign on it, as he explained why Moore's Law does not actually give us any way to predict advanced AI arrival times.  It's disheartening to find these same disclaimers quoted as evidence that the speaker thinks advanced AI is a nonissue.

Science isn't done by issuing press releases announcing breakthroughs just as they're needed.  First there have to be pioneers and then workshops and then grants and then a journal and then enticing grad students to enter the field and maybe start doing interesting things 5 years later.  Have you ever read a paper with an equation, a citation, and then a slightly modified equation with a citation from two years later?  It means that slight little obvious-seeming tweak took two years for somebody to think up.  Minor-seeming obstacles can stick around for twenty years or longer, it happens all the time.  It would be insane to think you ought to wait to start thinking until general AI was visibly just around the corner.  That would be far far far too late.

I've heard LeCun is an actual skeptic.  I don't know about any others.  Regardless, Hawking has not committed the sin of saying things that are known-to-the-field to be stupid.  Maybe LeCun thinks Hawking is wrong, but Russell disagrees, etcetera.  Hawking has talked about these issues with people in the field; he is not contradicting an existing informed consensus and it is inappropriate to paint him as having done so.

A *Paris* hydra is unimaginably bigger than Graham's Number.  How can I put this...

Let's say that it takes one Deep Insight Into Recursion to construct the Ackermann function, and given this Deep Insight, Graham's Number isn't too much harder.

It would then take a Second Deep Insight Into Recursion (the fast-growing hierarchy and indexing by the ordinals up to epsilon-naught) to construct a Paris hydra, which is as far beyond Graham's Number as Graham's Number is beyond twenty-seven.

It would then take a *third* Wholly New Foundational Insight Into Recursion to conceive of the Feferman-Schutte ordinal, a *fourth* Deep Insight to conceive of the large Veblen ordinal, a *fifth* Deep Insight to conceive of the Howard-Bachmann ordinal, and...

...you guessed it, the Sixth Deep Insight Into Recursion that sends you as far beyond the Fifth Deep Insight as Graham's Number is beyond twenty-seven, is what you need to describe the size of the Buchholz hydra.

(If there's a Seventh Insightful Step of equal magnitude known to modern mathematics, I haven't yet encountered a comprehensible explanation of it.  However, the sequence of Deep Insights into Recursion that are not conceptually attainable just from the previous Deep Insights is known to continue forever, and they are known to be linearly ordered in strength.  Mathematical logic: what theology would look like if it had been invented by grownups.)

&gt; Other more sci-fi options could include Brainiac, taking the form of a Grey Goo nano-swarm run by an AI hivemind with the utility function to collect and store all information in the universe. It of course took this to the extreme and started disassembling everything to store its atomic structure.

The phrase "took this to the extreme" took me aback, and I had to pause and remember that not everyone would go directly from "collect and store all information in the universe" to the obvious maximum at "disassemble everything and store its structure".

I hadn't meant to imply that interpretation.  If there was another level of defense, Snape would either be unable to talk about it or hint at it, or he'd be able to describe it right out.  Snape is just thinking about all the other terrifyingly cunning things he's seen Voldemort do.

My intended interpretation was that Quirrell found a Type 2 horcrux and that events were something like as follows:

1.  Tom Riddle learns Horcrux 1.
2.  Makes diary from Myrtle.
3.  Makes six other Horcrux 1s from shiny things, places them in locations where they would activate after his death.
4.  Completes Horcrux 2.
5.  Realizes that Horcrux 2s no longer need to be left where they can be found (so far as he knows).
6.  Makes Horcrux 2s from shiny things, hides them behind Inferi.
7.  Gets older, realizes younger self was bloody idiot and failed to update strategy fully, starts mass-manufacturing Horcrux 2s from pebbles and portkeying them into the sea.    Retrieves Horcrux 1s, hides all except one final Horcrux 1 fallback in very secure location only undone if he goes missing for long time.
8.  Tries to use Horcrux 1 spell on Harry, fails.
9.  Quirrell founds old Horcrux 2 generated in step 6.

LOL, money.

Besides winning one big lottery ticket, you can also use the standard Oracle trick to steal Bitcoins.  Or anything else that used to be nailed down with asymmetric encryption.  Or make the only stable time loop be the one where you found a really good blackmail prospect.  

&gt; Which somehow, in the pages I don't have access to, shows that due to the fact that prices are not stable over time, we aren't subject to time traveling arbitrageurs.

Oh, that's obvious.  Arbitrageurs eliminate predictable price changes in liquid markets, time travelers predict all price changes, therefore all prices in liquid markets become stable...

Twilight: unusually extreme fantasy of perfect safety from the man courting her.  Edward literally cannot harm Bella.  He's bound to her, must protect her, she calls all the tunes and proceeds exactly at her own pace.

50SoG:  The viewpoint character is trying to redeem Grey from his BDSM, thereby allowing people to read it without abandoning their initial frowny face at BDSM.  (Sort of like how 'Nickeled and Dimed' goes to extreme lengths to prevent the reader from imagining themselves directly in the shoes of poor people and to constantly emphasize how you're not really in that world.)

If I was trying to write a blockbuster bestseller, my first step would be to look for an extreme fantasy with a huge audience in fanfiction that wasn't being satisfied by mainstream fics... but I'd be limited by my ability to understand that fantasy *deeply*, *truly*, make it a part of myself rather than some imagined Other I was condescending to.  I don't think I'd have gotten the concept of either Twi or 50S if my more literate friends had not pointed it out to me.  I would have produced a parody, not the real thing, not with the deep notes that make the fantasy really resonate.  If I was trying to 'write a blockbuster romance' I would not have had Bella be perfectly safe, if I was trying to 'write a blockbuster BDSM story' I would not have had Grey be redeemed.

On the other hand, HPMOR is an underserved fantasy (unknown even in fanfiction) that I understand extremely well, including the deep notes that other authors wouldn't have known to include.  Someone else would have tried to write 'Batman, only he's smart instead of using fists' and whoooaaa daisies would they have screwed that up.  I can similarly imagine, by analogy if not by direct knowledge, that I would have been no better able to write Twilight or 50 Shades.  I don't know what I'm missing, but I know it's not there.

&gt; but it's important to distinguish that from "write like she writes," because we can point to a dozen others who are writing like she writes that do not enjoy a fraction of her popularity.

WHY ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN DO THIS?!  Is the concept of "maybe there's a difference but I'm not able to perceive it" *that* impossible to convey?  YES there's noise in sales but you don't know what's noise!  Especially when you're not yet a bestselling author or even me, you should not be confident that you are seeing everything in a work that could possibly be causing OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT YOU to buy that work!

(This also goes through my head every time somebody claims that HPMOR is "better written" than HP, or conversely that HPMOR is "poorly written".  Different readers have different problems for authors to solve!)

&gt; and the published stuff has far less in common with their fanfic

Gosh, I wonder if that could maybe have been the problem?

&gt; And the quality is better

People keep *saying* that about work that sells *fewer copies* and you have to at least *ask* whether you're *failing to see* the other work's key characteristic that is causing it to sell *more copies*.

Free advice from a good author: try never claiming that you know better than an author who is selling more copies than you, try to figure out what they're doing right, see where that takes you.  Should be on the Evil Overlord list somewhere:  When the hero has defeated you, try learning from what they just did instead of talking about how the hero wasn't worthy to defeat you.

Hi!  This is the Market Economics Fairy!  Predicting a significant change in asset prices is pretty much impossible to a single human being because there are hundreds of hedge-fund managers trying to do the same thing!  By now the stock price of this company has already incorporated any news that you've seen on Reddit!  You won't be able to make a profit based on that news because it's not private information and other market actors already know it!  Whether you wait now or buy later your expected returns on this stock are pretty much the same as on a broad market index fund, only with more volatility!  It won't even be an unusually bad stock unless it's also unusually difficult to short-sell for some reason!  It's just the same as any other stock!  If this isn't obvious to you then you definitely should not be trying to trade individual stocks at all, ever!  Just buy a minimal-load index fund like Vanguard and walk away!

I was concluding based on canon evidence, though I've heard others saying that canon!WoG asserts differently.  It does look to me like there's a Muggles-Can't-See effect in canon that doesn't apparently apply to Mr. Filch.

I confirm that this is the most important question remaining in HPMOR.  If you only knew the true, exact answer, it would explain so many other things... or am I bluffing?

Yes, not a pure meritocracy, but be careful what you dismiss as luck.  Just because one author had a luck *component* doesn't mean that another author couldn't do it by pure skill or that the first author did it using no unusual skill.  And certainly, claiming that EL James just got "lucky" is a great way never to learn to do what they did.

&gt; That's why I think it is significant that the richest writers aren't the ones with this training, and are often producing provably less skilled prose -- works riddled with mistakes beyond those usually linked to literary classism. 

Dan Brown is doing other clever things.  EL James is doing other clever things.  These things make up for what you claim to be 'mistakes' in the prose, which clearly the actual readers do not regard as very important.  Trying to look at lit-mag style judgment of prose as the only objective metric of a 'skilled author', the only kind of skill that can exist in writing, is your mistake here from the beginning and it's a pretty drastic mistake.  There are other authorial skills than these.  I expect that someone who publishes in a lit mag is completely unskilled at things I see as basic, probably starting with the concept of providing hedons to the reader having been neglected in their education. Most books on writing written by successful authors will give you similar advice, some of it even blunter than the way I just phrased it.

I've got no problem with readers who are like "Why is Harry all angry at Dumbledore? How unreasonable!" though in a perfect world they would notice that *all the surrounding text is pointing this out* and showing how Dumbledore is staying calm and there's a blazing anger pouring into Harry's mind 'from nowhere' and realize that *yes the author means you to notice*... but I think I'm starting to generalize a sort of broad rule here that maybe the modern Internet is encouraging the systematic overuse of Doylist explanations, especially those unfavorable to the author, and there is not much that can save these readers once they fall into the trap.

(Harry isn't keeping his reductionist priors.  He's just challenging the purported evidence that ought to make him believe that even the magical-language prior happens to contain souls.  More probable?  Absolutely.  But that doesn't mean you don't need enough evidence to support the 'soul' hypothesis, it's still just one hypothesis in a vast set of possibilities even if the magical language makes it far easier to describe.  Generate random universes written in a supernatural description language, and most of them won't contain souls.)

Yeah, let's have Tom Riddle react with careful reasoning while Dumbledore is talking to him about the afterlife, that would be totally in character.

Since I am me, I know there's insufficient reason for Harry to believe in souls though a higher prior than before.  *Harry is reliving the emotions of Tom's final conversation with Dumbledore.*  And at some point I start feeling less sympathetic to the misinterpretation when *all* of the mistake is going through people trying to interpret Yudkowsky when for God's sake just look at the frigging character and take them for what they are shown to be.

Meeting these *is* writing skill.  The notion that an MFA (BBA?) would represent greater writing skill is... um... it reveals very different background assumptions than the ones I use.

Meh.  Enough writing skill and you can win by skill instead of luck.  I've yet to read online the equivalent-skill-of-Terry-Pratchett book that the author just couldn't get published.

Until I've made as much money as EL James, I have no intention of sneering at their abilities as an author.  (Afterwards I still have no intention of sneering at their abilities as an author because sneering really really really isn't good for you.)

I suppose it might be comforting to believe that a richer author got that way by "luck" or "other factors", but the truth is, if I knew exactly what EL James had done right and could do the same myself, it would obviously be worth my time to do it.  I have not much more reason to believe I could successfully write like EL James than I do to believe I could write like Neil Gaiman.

&gt; The wizarding world's base rate explanation for getting hit with a pie from nowhere should be "Oh, an invisible time turned copy of someone threw it." 

Their base rate explanation is that somebody cast a spell.  The point of the things Harry does is that he manages to do them as a first-year instead of a seventh-year.

Also, let's be really really clear that HPMOR was not built to punch at Rowling's Harry Potter.  I'm a money-positive person and I genuinely believe that the amount of money Rowling made off Harry Potter demonstrates that she is a better writer, because a whole lot of those dollars were made by teaching tens of millions of children to love reading and I've never pulled off anything like that.

*Please* don't tell OP to try to keep reading.  Do some things change in future chapters?  Sure.  Is OP going to start enjoying the fic?  I really doubt it.  The world will be a better place for all of us if we can all just learn to *stop reading literature we don't like.*

It's okay to tell them that the story's real Sane Person turns out to be Dumbledore, that the story's actual premise is Tom Riddle growing up again, remind them that the author contains *all* of the characters within himself and the protagonist is only one of them, or argue that the point of reusing Time-Turners is that once you have sufficient hero equipment there is no reason to introduce new hero equipment and that just makes the story less solvable, etcetera, but *don't tell them to keep reading the fic*.  Anyone who gets to Ch. 67 with the primary feeling that they want HJPEV to be slapped down *much* harder is not going to get a future slapdown hard enough to satisfy them, and would do better to read fiction written by an author who isn't blind to one of their most cherished emotions.

Affirm.  Natural selection and human intelligence will both have complicated signatures coming from the way they compute things.  A law of physics that selects stable possibilities should give rise to stable loops that are (if you end up in a random one) just randomly selected from among all stable loops; there should be no visible signature of how the loop might've been reached, aside from "It's a random stable one."

Yep!  It sounds like there's no such thing as a red-antigreen gluon, only more complex gluon states that combine amplitudes for multiple such configurations, and there's only 8 independent basis vectors for the permitted set of such amplitudes, but all 9 configurations still exist to be assigned amplitudes.

In which case "Transfigure a red quark" would indeed make sense if not for the infinite potential energy thing, unless that's itself an impermitted form of the wavefunction (e.g. discontinuous or some such).

I'm familiar with the quark-separation energy going to infinity, but then does an expanding sphere of chaos have a *lower* infinite potential energy?  (I am not a physicist, but contemplating this question makes me feel like trying to Transfigure a single quark ought to produce a "Sorry the ontology of the universe can't represent that" error, like trying to Transfigure the number two (Harry did not try *that* experiment because he is still an insufficiently abstract thinker, and I wouldn't try it because Do Not Mess With Ontology.))

Please feel free to ignore the following question, but if you don't mind my committing the sin of pestering a physicist:

I read that there were only 8 gluons instead of the expected 9 gluons Because Of Reasons, and then nobody actually said "But the missing gluon is red-antigreen."  My guess, on reading this, was that 'color' was something sufficiently abstract that you couldn't point to a lone quark and say "See, the color that one has, that one is 'red'" because if that were true I'd also expect you to be able to point to a lone gluon and say "red-antigreen" and then you'd be able to point to 7 other gluons like that and there'd be some specific type of gluon you couldn't point to.

What was the first step of that reasoning which went wrong?

(Assume strong mathematical ability but little prior familiarity - you can throw math objects at me, but please name them in enough specificity for Googling.)

Sir or madam, if you say that there's such a thing as a lone red quark to be Transfigured, I humbly accept your correction.

Part of Harry's character, which isn't going to change in the first 24 hours after his awakening, is that his search for solutions tends to start by asking about extrema of the possibility space; and when that search turns up a solution he doesn't thoroughly search for downgrades to less extreme solutions that might still work. In this case, the problem is destroying the world, and Harry thinks about unbound quarks rather than unbound electrons because his mind automatically went to the strong nuclear force because it's strongest.  He doesn't think about color confinement particularly because he's not a string theorist, he just knows you're not supposed to have single quarks for some reason that involves very powerful confining forces; I model him as knowing that quarks come in colors and that every baryon has all three colors, but I don't model him as knowing that the quark-confinement forces are about color neutrality rather than, e.g., up needing to go with down.

I don't think that's how color charge works, though I could be mistaken - I'm not sure a 'red quark' exists as a Transfigurable entity.  But that doesn't matter because the unbalanced electrical charge will form a charged black hole and then strip off all the electrons in a 400 light-year radius.

Harry is being depicted as speculating and being right for the wrong reasons - the danger is even worse, you only need to Transfigure 'electrons', but I felt it would be unrealistic for him to figure that out on the spot.

* 1-21 HJPEV and the Methods of Rationality
* 22-37 HJPEV and the Professor's Games
* 38-64 HJPEV and the Shadows of Death
* 65-85 HJG and the Phoenix's Call
* 86-99 HJPEV and the Last Enemy

That's already a sufficient answer, to some degree; but the main problem was that after Book 3 I read enough Harry Potter fanfiction that my brain started to think of the Potterverse as a grownup place and when I went back to Book 4, it felt too young.

Read the first 3 books, watched the next 5 movies, checked the wiki often, and most importantly, read at least a hundred other Harry Potter fanfictions.  I know off the top of my head who Fleur Delacour's little sister is, in fact I've read a whole book about her bonding to Harry Potter's ghost after he dies in the Second Task of the Triwizard tournament.

Maybe Amelia went to burn Narcissa and Dumbledore spirited her away and substituted a burnable action figure first!

No, sorry, /u/75thTrombone just called this one incorrectly among his many victories.  I apologize for having Amelia talk about fire - I hadn't *meant* the concept of fire to be uniquely keyed to Narcissa, it's just a common magical cause of violent death.  One of the lessons HPMOR has taught me is that while it's all fine and good to bury hints, it causes people to legitimately be misled by a lot of textual accidents that were not meant as hints.

I'm not sure what you do in a case like that; I'd have to ask a real economist.  Fundamentally, you want as many trades as possible to occur.  If supply is rising sharply then you want enough money to lubricate the flow of trades for that supply.  And if an NGDP level target hasn't already been established, you might as well let NGDP rise along with RDGP in that case... so far as I can see.

It's already been established that Harry is a market monetarist, so he's exceedingly unlikely to print more gold than he needs to maintain an NGDP level target and the maximum feasible level of economic activity, which in turn implies some inflation - if you don't have enough money flowing to bid competitively on goods, then you are probably not operating the economy at maximum capacity and more trades will occur if you print more money.  Since prices are also much more sticky downward than sticky upward for psychological reasons, some degree of inflation (limited and predictable) also helps market prices to adjust faster and increases efficiency.

A brief glance at the charts for US money supply vs. US core inflation will serve to dispel the notion that printing twice as much money causes prices to double.  It's all about how much money is flowing through the economy, not how much is being printed.

If panic at the prospect of the Philosopher's Stone causes some old families to dump gold into circulation thereby pushing nominal demand past the ability of the economy to supply it and causing inflation to exceed desired levels, Harry should charge gold for youth-restorations or cosmetic uses of the Stone, and then store that gold or even, to make the point, outright destroy it.  This would continue until Harry had either destroyed enough gold to bring NGDP growth back to the level target, or until families reacted to the visible destruction of gold by regaining confidence in the future value of gold in their vaults.  Unfortunately, a lack of hedge-fund managers means that the rational expectations channel is likely to be highly impaired from Harry's perspective, and that he will in fact need to destroy the gold rather than just showing his willingness to do so.

This is why Harry also ponders in 117 that the Stone gives him the ability to sell 'useful services' as well as the ability to create gold.  By demanding gold from the economy in exchange for youth, Harry has the ability to remove gold from circulation as well as adding it, and can act as the magical economy's central banker despite its gold standard.

It's basically rationalization of the original canon puzzle, where the "Pettigrew is Scabbers!" answer just doesn't fit with the tone of the rest of HPMOR.  Similarly Horcruxes were divided into Horcrux 1.0 like the diary and Horcrux 2.0 for the artificial soul, not because of any point of departure, but because that was the rational affordance of the canon observations.  The initial canon observations interpreted as though by rational folk are that Sirius Black *is* guilty, but something was very strange at the trial; then we just make what we can of that.

&gt; The old wizard sighed deeply. "You may not still think so after understanding what I have to say. I'm afraid, Harry, that I've been manipulating you your entire life. It was I who consigned you to the care of your wicked stepparents -"

&gt; "My stepparents aren't wicked!" blurted Harry. "My parents, I mean!"

&gt; "They aren't?" Dumbledore said, looking surprised and disappointed. "Not even a little wicked? That doesn't fit the pattern..."

&gt; Harry's inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs, SHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE'LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM!

&gt; "No, no," said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, "I was just trying to spare your feelings, they're actually very wicked..."

&gt; "They are?" Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently. "What do they do?"

&gt; Talk fast "they, ah, I have to do dishes and wash problems and they don't let me read a lot of books and -"

&gt; "Ah, good, that's good to hear," said Dumbledore, leaning back again. He smiled in a sad sort of way. "I apologise for *that*, then."

I don't think a reminder later in the year will hurt.  However, I note the following:

* Anyone with attending or, I think, supporting membership in the 2015 Worldcon is eligible to vote for the 2016 Hugos.
* I had *not* intended to ask my readers to buy supporting memberships they would otherwise not buy.  Besides effective altruist efficiency considerations, a Best Novel Hugo for derivative literature of source material still under copyright (aka 'fanfiction') would be a new thing, and there should not be the slightest hint of impropriety about the process or non-fen trying to flood it.

Mmmaybe.  The epilogue is *not* ready to go (which is a reason I did state) and I did *not* think people would want more delays.  And I also feel something along the lines of, "The story as it stands is a completed work, and the story plus the epilogue would also be a completed work, and I want people to have a chance to react to both." And a lot of people *are* talking about doing their own ends/epilogues to HPMOR and I *do* want to give them a chance without my own epilogue standing there for comparison.  &amp;c.  You're welcome to not be persuaded for yourself, but there are certainly reasons.

&gt; In 115 you mention Harry's numbness, and a sort of LogicHarry autopilot. Yet he still gives significant emotional consideration and thought to LV and Hermione, whilst not-thinking of Quirrell (except as a prop) and the Death Eaters (whom he still regarded as skull masks and NPCs, even as he shoved down the trauma of killing them). Harry's default action appeared to be to protect himself and the narrative that he wanted, damn everyone else. Tbh, I'm most upset that he denied Quirrell the opportunity to be remembered as himself, and have his victimhood recognized in death. That eulogy erased the real Quirrell and lauded a fake PQ, the PQ that LV was pretending to be while possessing Quirrell, taking Quirrell's agency, and silencing Quirrell.

I basically agree with this, but would substitute "protect himself and the narrative that he was thinking about at all, all other lines of thought being not present due to lack of computing power" rather than writing as if these lines of thought were present but shoved down.

But when Harry does figure out that he could have tried to save the Death Eaters, he's going to imagine himself trying to tell the Aurors to save and cool the heads, with all the possible political pitfalls that would have implied, wondering if he would have done it to save murderers who were still human beings... and then, some time later, Harry is going to realize how easy it would have been to cut off and cool and Transfigure Quirinus's head, the lower volume and mass making for a relatively smaller expenditure of magic, and how nobody would have questioned that one missing head, and how Harry definitely would have done *that* if he'd thought of it.  And that will be the straw of added guilt that breaks the camel's back; Harry will understand that sometimes he just doesn't think of things until too late, and that it doesn't necessarily make him a terrible person, but he does need to think faster next time.

I admit to being a bit surprised that the topic was raised earlier and then apparently not bubbled up by the Reddit mechanism to being 'the obvious thing Harry should have done', and I think there's definitely [some of this effect](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/) going on, along with Lucius being a more interesting character than Quirinus and hence his life looming larger as being of value.

PS: AK destroying brains is just Opinion of God until we actually see it in the fic.

Leeet's be a little careful about the uncharitable conclusions we draw about people, even imaginary people, shall we?

For example, I just looked through this thread, and I didn't see anyone mention the one head that Harry should've tried above all to cool and Transfigure - namely that of Quirinus Quirrell, who, so far as Harry or I know, is innocent of anything except being fooled by Tom Riddle.  And who might even have some ancient knowledge available in his head to boot.  Now, I've been assuming that Avada Kedavra destroys the brain thoroughly enough to lose the information and prevent revival in the original body, which is why it could kill even empowered!Hermione; but Harry doesn't know I've made that assumption, and neither did the rest of you.

Why did you horrible, horrible people forget that poor Quirinus Quirrell's innocent head even existed?

Because you were so busy debating the morality of killing Death Eaters and what it means for Harry's personality, you were so busy debating the controversial part of the issue, that you forgot about the *innocent* person whose head was *also right there*.

I gave you all a day to notice, and you didn't. If there's any section of /r/hpmor where someone says, "Forget Lucius, forget MacNair, what about *Quirrell?*" then I haven't gotten to it yet.

My model of Harry is basically the same as my model of what just happened to all of you - that Harry's brain was seizing up about the Deep Moral Issue (in this case, what it means to him personally that he killed people, and whether he should think about that now or later, and whether it's going to hurt and should hurt) and hence he was *distracted* and didn't notice all his opportunities to do good, like saving Quirinus Quirrell's head even if he couldn't help anyone else.

Be careful in how uncharitable you are to the literary characters you're trying to outthink.  Realistic human models *make mistakes.*  Even actual humans make mistakes and overlook their most important opportunities when hundreds of them are given days to think about it.  I don't think you're a terrible person for forgetting about Quirinus Quirrell's head.  It didn't occur to me for a while that Harry could try to save the other Death Eaters' heads, because my mind is not infinitely fast and when I first plotted out that point I hadn't written through the Time Pressure arc in enough detail to fully internalize that Frigideiro+Transfiguration is cryonics with all that implies.  I just think that's how humans work - too slowly, and being distracted by other things.  And so that's how I model Harry working.

So to everyone who came here to post about how Harry should have tried to call someone in to Frigideiro and Transfigure the Death Eater's heads for later attempted revival...

Harry hasn't thought of that yet.

He hasn't yet spent enough time thinking about the information-theoretic criterion of death that he *automatically* looks at the recently severed head of a dead body and sees someone who's still alive and in need of saving.

Harry is going to think of it a week later, maybe, while he's going through it in his head wondering if there was something better he could have done.  I think that's what's realistic, all things considered.  I didn't see that option for at least a day after I plotted out that point, so Harry shouldn't see it instantly either, especially when he's busy trying to not think about the awful thing he just did, or properly manage the guilt the way his model of Moody says he should.

Sure is pointlessly tragic, huh? If only wizards did this sort of thing more often, so that Harry wasn't the only one who apprehended the possibility. By the way, everyone who came here to post about how Harry should have tried to call someone in to Frigideiro and Transfigure the heads, you *have* actually taken the time and undergone the minor inconvenience to sign up yourself and your loved ones up for cryonics.  *Right?*  Because it would be even *more* pointlessly ironic and tragic if you wrote about how silly it was for Harry to miss that, and then you didn't do anything about it yourself.  Sort of like if I'd shown Harry criticizing a stage play where someone else had failed to preserve the severed heads of their enemies and the information inside, and then Harry himself didn't try to cool down Hermione in the crisis and just let her die.  Hint hint HINT *HINT* ***HINT.***

ADDED 4:  Reading over comments so far, it looks possible that the original demons (djinni?) are overpowered.  One way to address this would be for summoners have a single Djinni Effect centered on themselves.  If so, we can have more summoners without breaking the setting.  Malevolence of underspecified instructions as before.

ADDED 5:  Djinni depart upon the death of the summoner.  Short of that, the other rule for canceling them is to tell another Djinn to precisely counteract any force exerted by the first Djinn.

ADDED 6:  Rarely, a new person enters the Loops.  To give the reader a novice's-eye-view, the story may open from the perspective of a summoner-mathematician entering the Loops for the first time (that is, this is their second life) and being strangely greeted by the other Loopers as they demand to know what the hell happened.  Their previous life's memory might be baseline or it might be the previous Loop; I'm leaning toward the latter.

ADDED 7:  Some credit for this terminology ("Loops", "Looper", "baseline") is due the Infinite Loops fanverse which was sparked by Innortal.

ADDED 8: The opening situation of the Loop is not always the same.  *People* tend to be the same each time, including their names, but the history of the world or even the previous tech level sometimes changes.  The protagonists retain their memory of mathematical bindings and so on, but they can't rely on typical Groundhog Day tactics - situations may not be precisely repeatable.  This also permits that if a reader invents obvious new technology that should have been there all along, the world might have it on future Loops.

ADDED 9: The Djinn senses light and sound impinging on its center. You cannot tell it to 'read out a human brain' unless you can tell an advanced cognitive binding how to create nanogoo that does that safely.  You could also tell something like AIXI-tl to induce simplest explanations for the light and sound and hope that contained a brain, but it'll take some serious thinking to figure out how to do anything with the data inside the 'simplest explanation'.

I think it was always done.  I suppose that at some point in history, states became large enough to have more than one summoner in power balances, followed by equilibria being maintained long enough for economic progress.  Summoners are immensely powerful military forces, but they're not gods and there's more than one of them.

Good question.  Assuming for now that all demons have the same strength, I think nothing would happen, because the first demon would be able to apply equal and opposite force to the second, to the limit of their ability to apply force.

Though in that case, the second demon has been given an unsatisfiable instruction, and you didn't tell it what to do otherwise, so it can now do whatever it wants...

Demons don't seem to think of themselves as conscious. If you say, "Hey, Demon, I'll tell you do whatever you want if you claim to be conscious at me", they'll say "Sure, I'm conscious!" but if you instruct them to write a paper on the hard problem of conscious experience they won't do all that well. (Though I'm not sure how one would go about instructing a Demon to converse with you... if they're allowed to vibrate the air, maybe they can produce a sonic shock that liquifies your head or eardrums...)

You couldn't create a temporary version of the Stone.

I should mention that on my headcanon of HPMOR (not even Opinion of God here, just my personal headcanon), the Mirror is around after the destruction of Atlantis's Time because it was perfectly stable, and a small group of wizards who hid inside became the ancestors of all modern wizards.

The Stone is around after the deletion of all Atlantis's other effects from Time because the Stone was not caused by Atlantis.  It's older than that.

I have an old Worm/canon-HP story start, inspired by the link above, that never went anywhere.  With a very early Skitter, so that she actually notices the opponent.

-------------------

"Voldemort?" Regent said.  The young curly-haired man shook his head in incredulity.  "Even for a cape, that name is just..."

"Ten million dollars if we can take him alive," Tattletale said simply.  "That offer isn't aimed at us in particular, but I thought with Grue and Skitter we'd have a shot."

You could have heard a pin drop, probably for miles.  I sat bolt upright in the sofa I'd been lounging and didn't even try to disguise my shock.  Our mysterious sponsor was weirdly generous, but this... split five ways that was two *million* dollars.  Some people never see that much over their whole working lives before they retire.

"All right," Brian spoke for all of us, "who is this guy?"

Tattletale slapped a folder down on the common-room table, and I leaned over with everyone else to study the picture that adorned the cover, a tall man, bald, with a weirdly inhuman face; the nose was too large, flat... I don't know how to describe him.  "Nose put together wrong, and bald" didn't convey the total impression of inhumanity that this cape's picture radiated.  I'd seen pictures of Weld, on the Wards, the guy made out of metal, and *he* looked less inhuman than Voldemort managed to look just by dint of being bald and having a funny nose.

"Powers?" I said.  There are other things that define a cape, but it's certainly the place to start.

Tattletale spread her hands.  "He calls himself a wizard, and damn me if he doesn't act the part.  If he gets a straight piece of wood in his hands and says Abracadabra, he can fire flashes of green light that'll kill most people in an instant.  Or a brown flash of light that'll make you feel the worst pain imaginable if it hits you.  A gray flash puts you under his control, indefinitely, you'll do anything he tells you to and feel warm and fuzzy while you kill your friends.  He can generate creatures made out of fire that will melt through steel in seconds.  He can transform a brick into a statue, and animate the statue.  He can levitate cars and throw that at you.  He can fly---"

"Who the hell is this guy?" said Grue, starting to look a little freaked.  "Eidolon's little brother?"

Tattletale paused.  "That's not such a bad description.  He's almost that versatile, with sixteen known powers and counting, and no known restriction on how many he can use at once.  But none of his powers punch in the weight class of Eidolon or Glaistig Ulaine.  No tidal waves or seas of fire. The green flash of death is his fastest weapon, the fire-creatures are as dangerous as his area-affect abilities go.  The super-pain spell I'll grant is scary---he used it on one pair of capes for fifteen minutes, and they've been in a psych ward ever since---but even there he's no Gray Boy.  One of the Protectorate's pet theories is that Voldemort is really a tinker who builds tech into thirteen-inch thin cylinders and paints them in wood grain...  But I've read through his file and that feels wrong to me."  Tattletale frowned thoughtfully.  "Voldemort's always talked himself up as a wizard, and I think that's his actual power; he casts spells, plain and simple.  Magic wand, magic words.  Our sponsor agrees."

"Why haven't I heard of this guy?" I said in some surprise.  "I mean, I've been reading the cape boards for a while, and you'd think there'd be more speculation about a guy like that."

"Five years ago, the Slaughterhouse Nine tried to recruit him, or so the file says.  Voldemort refused to play.  His body was pretty recognizable, even in as many pieces as the Siberian left it, and he was written off the books.  Only now he's been spotted approaching Brockton Bay."

Even Bitch sat up at that, though her hand never paused at petting the puppy she was carrying with her.  "Say what?" said Bitch, in the sharp voice that I'd started to recognize as are-you-lying-to-me?

Tattletale smiled, and not nicely.  "So what our sponsor thinks---and more importantly, what *I* think---is that somewhere in this guy's however-many spells is one that granted him the ability to come back five years after he was offed.  Voldemort has a *spell* which does that.  He casts spells and that's one of the things he can do by pointing a stick and saying the right words.  Pause for effect."  She looked at us in meaningful silence.

Brian got it first, or I did.  "Jesus Christ---" I said, at the same time Brian started to say, "Holy shit---"

"If he can cast that spell on someone else..." Tattletale said. "Well.  You see where the ten million dollar bounty comes in."

I did.

Tattletale kept talking.  "Voldemort's powers travel through the air as flashes of light, and have to be aimed.  I expect Brian's darkness would suppress them, or at least give him nowhere to aim.  Taylor covers him in bees and pumps him full of spider venom from a safe distance, I doubt he can use his fire-creatures on his own body unless he's willing to vaporize himself.  Easy target, for us."

*If nothing goes wrong.  But it will...*

I hadn't been with the Undersiders very long, but it'd been long enough to know that.

But if, somehow, I could arrange for the *Protectorate* to be the ones to end up with custody of Voldemort---I imagined that spell being cast on the capes going to an Endbringer attack.  The revived capes wouldn't be available for the next attack, it might take them five years to come back.  But five years was still something, and hell, the prospect of reviving later could bring a lot of capes out of the woodwork, ones who'd be afraid to take on an Endbringer otherwise.  Or if there was any way to accelerate the revival process, maybe some way to stack another cape's powers with Voldemort's... it could turn the tide, it really could.

There was no way I could turn my back on that, even knowing that, somehow, it was all going to go horribly wrong.

So that Harry could take the Unbreakable Vow, which used his wand.  If not for Partial Transfiguration, that would have been relatively safe.  Voldemort still underestimated Harry's threat level, in the end.

I remark that the thought occurred to me later that if I were Voldemort I would have some Death Eaters looking outward, not everyone looking just at Harry... but nobody called *that* out as stupid, because you were told not to expect cavalry.  Hindsight bias really is a thing.

EDIT: Observe replies below saying "Voldemort should've taken away the wand."  If Harry's glasses had contained something interesting instead, people would be saying, "Take away the glasses."

I did look at the text to see if there was a natural place to insert Voldemort saying "Drop the wand now" after ordering his Death Eaters to vigilance again, with Harry refusing and Voldemort just continuing as before, but there didn't seem to be a natural such place.

Yup.  This was a fascinating literary experiment, but that aspect is something I'm not sure how to handle if I wanted to repeat this.  It also seems very hard to create a literary puzzle that is calibrated to both individuals and to a large subreddit.

*Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line...*

I'm sorry there wasn't physically available time for me to write an alternate Ch. 114-115 that used all of your way more brilliant ideas.  I hope to do this later, with an Omake Files #5.  I tried for a rapid rewrite  of 114 that used your much more interesting stalling tactics than the one I had in mind from the original Ch. 114 (basically just the antimatter threat), but that was all I had time to write.  Admittedly, a lot of the more awesome stuff was Awesome But Impractical, or not as explicitly permitted by past story events.  But it was indeed cooler than I had in mind.

On a larger scale, the verdict is in: your collective literary intelligence has exceeded mine.  There were at least half a dozen brilliant ideas I'd never imagined.  I think the one that impressed me most was precommitting to cause an antimatter explosion unless Time-Turned help appeared - since the explosion would be visible from the Quidditch stands, and thus that would make the simplest timeline no longer be one in which Harry never reached the Time-Turner.

To be even remotely solvable to the individual reader, the story needed to use the heavily foreshadowed solution described in Ch. 1 and licensed in numerous other places.  The Swerving Stunner seems "too obvious" at your level of collective intelligence, but it was, yes, introduced for the sake of that very moment.  Most readers not connected to the Internet community did *not* solve the dilemma, and their initial responses were often "AAAHHHH IMPOSSIBLE".  It wouldn't be fair to those individuals readers to hit them with your more awesome and less predictable outcome - but your stuff was indeed cooler, I say it freely and with a bow of respect.  That's also why I told everyone not yet connected to /r/hpmor to stay away from /r/hpmor before reading Ch. 114.

You clearly could have done this *without my having tried* to deliberately set up a solution in the text, and you *still* would have solved it.  But I didn't know that back when I was planning the whole story, and during the pilot attempt on Ch. 80, your collective intelligence hadn't achieved this clear level of cognitive superiority.

You have exceeded your old master.  The power *I* knew not... was /r/hpmor.

*Bows again.*

Regarding feasibility:

* Anything that blatantly violates the rules (e.g. Harry just walks over to Hermione to wake her up) *and* does not make you laugh (the way I laughed at the Worm!solution of Harry Transfiguring his body to extend a thin line of flesh that forms another Harry) can be omitted.  Otherwise the index will be swamped by individualized impossibilities.
* Rescuable interesting individual elements can be extracted.  E.g., if the opening premise is that Harry should Transfigure X (without mentioning how Harry is to Transfigure anything), but X is interesting and new and small enough to be Transfigured in the time Harry could get using previously mentioned delaying tactics, you can just extract the X part and assume some other solution for Transfiguring things and stalling.

To be clear on a couple of things:  I *did* try to read reviews, and read the subreddit, but after spending at least 5 hours doing that on a plane yesterday, I had to admit defeat - and if there's no way I could see a brilliant new solution submitted later, if nobody even reads it and even brilliantly original ideas don't get immortalized as part of the Collective Intelligence's solution and/or Omake Files #5, this seems delinquent to the people doing work to submit them.  Sufficiently unfair that I would try to read them all myself - but I don't think I can *do* that in the time I have available.

Another way of looking at this is that compiling nonduplicated suggestions as input, including from the review firehose, is a key part of your collective intelligence.  Which is FASCINATING by the way, I'm looking at this and going, "Maybe the most critical task over the next 5 years is causing this to happen to the Friendly AI problem, and maybe one way to try that would be for my next work to be titled *Mathematically Specified Demons And Their Behavior.*"

Hi, anonkun!  I'm taking this moderately seriously but can't guarantee that I'll be the first author to step up.  Also, although some others have spoken of using this on a fundraising basis, I would not mind being paid directly for my next artistic endeavor.  (Of course I'd still free the IP for anyone else to use and get paid for, which is my own way of not being evil.)  I worry that the system I envision is relatively complicated, but one must always ask before assuming that something can't be done.  I'd want:

* The ability for any user to suggest a next course of action for the character.
* The ability for anyone to discuss those suggestions, using either nested or flat comments, but with comments being local to a particular suggestion.
* The ability to comment / post on a latest update in general.
* The ability for anyone to bid money on a course of action they prefer, which is collected only if that course of action is taken.
* The ability for anyone to bid money on the next N words, which is collected after the next N words are produced independently of any particular course of action.
* Ideally, the ability for the author to post one paragraph at a time, and for users to realtime-chat about the paragraphs.

After some worried thought, I've decided that it seems best for now not to award money to suggesters because it seems liable to create fights over a system that would otherwise operate well enough with just user interest.  (Sadly, not everyone in the world is money-positive or operates emotionally well with market norms.)  I hereby commit that, should I undertake such a project, 10% of revenue will go directly to some charity other than MIRI in order that I not profit personally from the above decision.

I would first want to run pilot paragraphs without money, but with voting, in order to see if the overall system works well for me as a format.

That's simply what Voldemort would do at this point.  If I tried to write it any other way, you'd see a lot of readers complaining about "Why doesn't Professor Quirrell do the sensible thing and strip off literally every item of Harry's that he can take?"  As it stands, we have people complaining that he left Harry his Charmed glasses.  I can only imagine what they would be saying if Harry was also wearing socks!

It's making me want my next story to be called *Mathematically Lawful Demons and Their Behaviors.*  Because if I could harness like 10% of the effort that goes into scrutinizing every single line of an HPMOR chapter and suggesting wiser character moves, into scrutinizing and inventing AI designs, the world would be a safer place than it is now.

Well, it works in prediction markets!  But my ideal setup would look like this:

* Anyone can make suggestions
* Anyone can bid money on suggestions
* I can take whatever suggestion I like or go down another path entirely, but I have an incentive to take options bid higher
* The winning suggester gets 10%

That thought didn't occur to me while editing for 10 minutes, so I rule that Harry is allowed to not think of it for like 10 seconds.

EDIT: Also PQ dispelled the barrier in order to grab the Cloak.

EDIT 2: Also my model of Harry doesn't try to commit suicide even if the barrier is still there.

When this is done, the thought has occurred to me to create a universe and let the readers vote (ideally with money) on what the character should do, and see if the result is something like a very weak superintelligence, because YOU'RE COLLECTIVELY SMARTER THAN HARRY AT THIS POINT AND POSSIBLY ME.  THERE I SAID IT.

That said, if you really thought that should have been knowable in advance, the time to post it was the last chapter when you only knew what Harry knew in the last chapter.  Did you?

It's true that Draco and Hermione don't act mature enough for their depicted age and intelligence level, I agree.  Smart 11 or 12 year olds will often say things with very adult phraseology, while I was trying to give Draco and Hermione a consistent voice that doesn't suddenly blurt out completely adult sentences.  Realistic!Draco and Realistic!Hermione would seem to vary much more in intelligence, maturity, and apparent voice between occasions, sounding like Harry one hour and Pansy Parkinson the next.

But yes, the said critics of D, H, and Neville have obviously never met any kids from the Study of Extraordinary Talent or similar populations.  Every now and then I get a review (on what are admittedly usually the earlier chapters of HPMOR) from someone who works with extremely talented kids, who gushes over how realistic *Harry* is.

Remember, as an author, my goal has been to construct challenges such that individual readers at least *sometimes* solve them.  In the beginning, my puzzles were way less transparent than I imagined, so opaque that almost nobody got them (I thought readers would start saying, "Oh, that's Tom Riddle" somewhere around Ch. 3).  The collective Reddit hivemind is a *lot* smarter than the average use-case - *every* puzzle that at least some readers can solve, *every* clue that at least 1% of readers spot, should with statistical inevitability be delivered to the 7,000-fold subscriber base of /r/HPMOR, and often recognized and upvoted as a solution despite all the non-solutions also on offer.  It didn't used to be that way, but it has been recently, and I think that's basically the correct literary decision.  (In fact, often there are plausible-looking clues and hints I didn't intend, and I sometimes go back and eliminate them because I don't want to lie to the reader - though there are limits on my ability to do this while the story is in progress.) Anyone who wants to be surprised by 80% of the things, instead of just 15% of the things, should not be reading the subreddit.

Perfect Occlumens.  Controlling body != trustworthy to read minds.  If magic offers a truly trustworthy way for a powerful wizard to read anyone's mind, it changes the entire society of wizardkind.  That, from a literary perspective, is why perfect Occlumency exists in the first place.

My reaction to your table was along the lines of "Why is this person distorting their right vs. leftwing classification to match my True Patronus classification?"  In particular, classifying David Brin as 'right-wing' to which I can only say LOLWHUT.  I suggest looking at Brin's Facebook wall, which consists almost entirely of Reasons You Should Not Vote Republican.  Vinge does not belong on that scale at all so far as I ever heard, and if you ask whether the Patronus correlates to libertarian advocacy or economic literacy then you may note Doctorow's absence.

Regarding other comments about e.g. Greg Egan, the classification is not about whether the author's works have immortality or even depict immortality in a good light.  It's about whether the author's characters show signs of being able to muster the bright silver emotion that Harry wields in Ch. 45.  Ostentatious cynics like Stross and Doctorow are not good candidates.  Greg Egan's works argue against bioconservatism but only because his characters think bioconservatives are idiots committing gross logical fallacies, not because his immortals are having [fun](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/). &amp;c.

I consider 'left-wing' vs. 'right-wing' a rather arbitrary dimension corresponding to a set of accidental historical alliances.  If I have a political allegiance these days, it's to any standard economics textbook with a side dose of Scott Sumner.  This places me firmly in opposition to every mainstream US politician on either side of the aisle, though admittedly Republicans are Even Worse as usual.

Not if all those magical countries had also undergone the same ethnic mixing, except for those immigrants with recent mudblood ancestry, which would then be much more visible / easier to detect.

I read a surprisingly good case for POC-Harry online, though I didn't save the link (based on Vernon Dursley's reaction to James Potter and his treatment of Harry).

Although every time I get a cameo name with a non-magical/non-British-sounding name I worry about it throwing my readers out of the story, in reality you'd expect magical Britain to have seen a lot of immigration, unless magical countries put up *very* strong barriers to immigration compared to even the crazy modern USA.  Wizards have had portkeys, which are even more convenient than airplanes, for presumably centuries, unless portkeys are somehow a recent invention.  There should have been a huge amount of ethnic mixing going on.  Arguably, everyone in magical Britain who isn't a Muggleborn (or a blood purist?) should, from our perspective, look like a random blend of Muggle ethnicities - maybe the same random blend if they've had enough centuries to mix into a steady state.  Bonus irony if this blend doesn't look like any particular Muggle ethnicity and that's why the blood purists distrust Muggleborns.

This mental process is mostly opaque to me, but one interaction with the 'rationalist' part of rationalist fiction comes from the [Double Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_act) aspect of comedy, in which the rationalist can either play the Straight or Only Sane Person via bringing a logical perspective to an illogical situation, or the Banana Person via bringing a confusing foreign perspective or thinking outside the box.

To introduce the setup for a comedic situation, you need both craziness and the perspective that reacts to the craziness.  I don't have a deliberate theory behind this; both the craziness, and writing the reaction to that craziness, come naturally to me.  But it's the best advice I can offer.

Relevant:  https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153083953399228

In general, I tend to be unimpressed with the 'transhumanism' of any author who strikes me as lacking the sense and love of life, carried into a brighter future, that would be necessary to cast a Patronus 2.0.  Also with those who seem to be disrespecting the power of cognitive intelligence.  Vernor Vinge tends toward the excellent, obviously, and Peter Hamilton also does very well on this dimension.

Even among transhumanist authors, good posthuman role models are obviously going to be exceedingly rare for Vinge's Law reasons.  Tunc Blumenthal from Across Realtime, Old One and the Blight in A Fire Upon the Deep, the Minds in Iain Banks's _Player of Games_ (the book that is the most lifeist of Banks's writings), and... I'm actually having trouble thinking of anything else.  Well, CelestAI.  Actually, CelestAI is about the most reasonably depicted superintelligence in fiction that I can recall, i.e., she is always ultimately depicted as getting what she wants for reasons of cognitive and technological advantage, which is really saying something about the difficulty of having one of those and still setting stories around them.

Depends how smart the God is.  Jehovah is telepathic and dislikes any hint of defiance, but It has a very limited focus of attention and probably isn't bothering to read your mind at any given time, and Its architecture is clearly humanlike in other ways.  It might be possible to subtly set up a clicker-training-like scenario in which Jehovah was reinforced into behaving in useful ways, pending its outright takeover by a constructed superintelligence.

Sir or Madam, I thank you first for your perspicacious and well-argued points.

It is not clear that HPMOR, which is (a) free, (b) very clear political expression, and (c) parody, would not be Fair Use under US law via the combination of these factors; I'm not aware of US law having tested a case like that.  Which is mostly irrelevant in real life, since it's not like the rule of law is still a thing around here.

There's a general question of how much value to lose, for never trying or doing certain things, for risk of upsetting certain applecarts.  For example, maybe I should never have written HPMOR because it attains a high profile and so brings down some terrible lightning upon all of fanfiction, independently of any worries about donations.  But I don't think that scenario is actually realistic, and I tend not to let low-probability disaster scenarios that I do not think will actually happen in real life, ward me off from generating value, e.g., writing HPMOR and thereby edifying readers, or asking for donations to a charity in an author's note.

Once HPMOR is complete, I might seek out some avenue to Rowling and ask about publishing HPMOR (maybe under the title "HJPEV and the Methods of Rationality") with all profits accruing to a mutually agreeable charity, on the basis that HPMOR has generated a lot of new buzz about Harry Potter and that it will contribute to keeping the brand alive and vital.  I mostly expect she'll say no or be overruled by suits.  But (if I get around to it) that expectation won't stop me from *trying* to generate even more value (in the form of more people enjoying HPMOR and income for the agreed charity), from *trying* to ask Rowling just to see what happens, *merely* because I mostly don't expect it to work.  I mostly didn't expect HPMOR to work.

This does reflect a more dynamic approach to life than keeping your head down and trying not to make trouble.  Whether that's *immoral*, or whether big disaster scenarios are realistic, is something where I might well disagree with someone else who feels a more instinctive drive to keep their head down.  And I'm not sure I can think of much to say about that, beyond that sometimes people disagree in life, and good and virtuous people may well find reason to criticize me for things that I actually say, do, or advocate, which does not lead me to respect them any less; and that to misrepresent what I do is another matter entirely, and it is the matter I was addressing here.

*Why* are you trying to catch the Road Runner?  Can you go to the supermarket and buy a roast chicken instead?

If you tell me that my utility function is just to catch the Road Runner, I think I'll start by taking some of my amazing inventions and selling them to Acme, then hiring mercenaries.  I will also try to place the Road Runner in morally compromising situations - maybe trolley problems - so as to try to strip It of Its plot immunity.  And I shall employ all my wits and perhaps professional comedy writers to set up a situation in which the Road Runner escaping simply cannot be as funny as the Road Runner being caught.

As said, I think there is a direct moral disagreement with people who think that *nobody* or *nobody associated with you in any way, including a nonprofit*, not just you, can be associated with any money whose movement is triggered by your fanfiction in any way... though in that case they really should be crusading against fanfiction.net for taking ads and thereby profiting off the fanfictions, one would think.

Personally, I give blanket permission to all to take my original fictional works, such as Three Worlds Collide, steal the world and characters, and sell their derivative works at a profit if they so desire.  I have a tremendous disagreement with the way modern copyright law is set up and I think the doujinshi culture of Japan, or Shakespeare's ability to riff off common works of his own era, are tremendously healthier than today's infinite copyright.  I don't think I'm morally entitled to royalties from the author of the off-Broadway play *Yudkowski Returns: The Rise and Fall and Rise Again of Dr. Eliezer Yudkowski* which was produced without my knowledge or consent.

http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction:

&gt; While I tend to publish most of my writing for free, I strongly believe that money is not evil. Therefore, anyone is welcome to take characters or settings from my original online fiction, such as the beisutsukai or the Baby-Eating Aliens, and use them in new commercial works of your own creation. I do ask for acknowledgment and a link or other reference to the original, but so long as the writing is your own, you may charge for access, distribute printed copies, sell the story to a magazine, etc. I don’t mind.

That general attitude does inform my approach to fanfiction, and while I diligently obey US laws against charging for fanfiction, and I am even okay with voluntarily abiding by both the letter and the spirit of a norm against asking for personal donations tied to fanfiction, I am not going to obey non-widely-agreed rules advocated by some individuals against advertising nonprofits, or whatever.  I have an open moral disagreement with those individuals, and I'm cheerful about that being a thing.

I will accept any and all criticism of what I actually did, accurately conveyed without distortions or sly phrasings.  I am *not* okay with my actions being misrepresented.

Besides the charity there (CFAR) being one to which I am financially unrelated, I furthermore remark that my salary wouldn't have changed at all in that circumstance, I would simply have been doing other things on a daily basis for a bit.  The story got finished anyway, though later, and my salary would have been unaffected by the counterfactual.

If people hate the idea of fanfiction being tied in any way to charity, then yes, I explicitly disagree and am 'guilty' as charged; I think it's perfectly fine to use the medium to advertise charities.  But if they think I'm profiting personally off HPMOR, like the original post implies by saying that I'm 'asking for donations' (slyly implied: to myself personally), then I never made a red cent and wasn't intending to.  No, not even indirectly in terms of increased job security or improved salary negotiating leverage.  Most of MIRI's funding doesn't come from anywhere near HPMOR, I've been working there for 10 years before HPMOR was a thing, and the marginal funding donated to MIRI by some HPMOR readers genuinely doesn't affect my salary at all.  Yes, really actually in practice.  I helped cofound MIRI, which means that I'm core personnel whose salary isn't in doubt; I was already funnelling donations to MIRI in ways that have nothing to do with HPMOR; and I voluntarily work far under my market value.  I already had 'brings in donations' as an attribute before HPMOR was a thing, HPMOR still isn't most of that attribute, and I don't use that attribute as salary negotiation leverage because nonprofit cofounder. Donations from HPMOR readers do not affect my job status or salary; they just make MIRI more able to do more other things like running decision theory workshops.

P/S/A: The original post is a lie, no one's ever paid me a cent for HPMOR and I have no intention of ever asking for one.

The actual event which the trollpost is twisting is that one time while the charity I work for was running its annual fundraising campaign and seemed to be in danger of not making it, I said that upcoming chapter releases would be 1 per 2 days instead of 1 per 4 days if the charity made its fundraising goal.  My salary did not depend on this fundraising goal in any way, theoretically or actually.  Furthermore, the number of chapters being released was predefined, so there wasn't additional content being generated or held hostage in exchange for donations - what I'd already written was just being released faster, depending on whether the charity made its fundraising goal.

I've advertised other charities as well in the author's notes of HPMOR, and don't regret it.  I doubt J. K. Rowling regrets it either, and if she does, she's welcome to say so.

http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent

Larry Niven also suggested that you could write more intelligent characters by spending extra thinking time.  I have not so far found this to be the case.  I've found that 'extra thinking time' plays surprisingly little role in the limited violations of Vinge's Principle that can be deployed.  If a character can solve a problem in a setup, at all, I can probably find that solution as soon as I look; I don't have any memories of needing to look hard for an extra hour, and then finally finding something.  If I can make a character be intelligent at all, I can probably write out their dialogue and thoughts at typing speed.  The limited violations of Vinge's Principle I know how to deploy come from backstory being established, filtering for solvable problems, decision to depict the solution as actually working, and none of these things exploit extra thinking time.

The Auror didn't *know* who the time-criminal was, neither did the Department, hence they couldn't turn off just that Time-Turner.

Unless, you know, it's just a story.  I mean I can't imagine being driven insane by that, but then it's hard for me to imagine being driven insane by a lot of other things I've heard described as triggering events.

Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga, Iain Banks's Culture, Walter John Williams's Aristoi, Jack Vance's Tschai: Planet of Adventure.  These are either already rational (Vorkosigan Saga), or they're partially rational and the remaining irrationality is so deeply buried in the premise that you can't fix it without ripping apart the universe (Culture, Aristoi), or the protagonist is already Level 1-2 Intelligent and the rest of the book is so well-written that any attempt to change things would just make you look sad (Tschai).

So far this looks like standard SF worldbuilding, I don't detect any invocation of rationality as yet.

Having one of these background facts be unknown to the characters, be important, and leave causal shadows allowing its deduction, is potentially a setup for a Fair Play Insight.

And *that* is what makes a rationalfic within the broader genre of science fiction.  Well done.

Not that it's unrealistic to have fools in charge of a big government project #civilizational_inadequacy but the mark of rationalfic is that somebody, somewhere is thinking more clearly than usual.

It's increasing the probability on the depression side, not decreasing the probability on the death side.

Likelihood ratios are how much *more* likely an observation is, given one hypothesis, *compared to* the other hypothesis; and also assuming that all previous observations were in fact generated by that hypothesis.

So what we're asking is, what is the *ratio* of the probability that something manifests as a flying corpse, given that:

* The thing is depression, and eats your soul / puts your body in a mindless coma if it kisses you
* The thing is death, and eats your soul / puts your body in a mindless coma if it kisses you

I think I was indeed too stingy with myself and meta-contrarian in calling this ratio 1:2, but it has to be more even than the *ratio* of the probabilities of something manifesting as a flying corpse, given:

* The thing is depression
* The thing is death

where the likelihood ratio is more like "Huh, why would depression do that... well, maybe really *serious* depression" to "*of course* Death would do that, it *usually* does that".  I again might've been too harsh on myself in calling this 1:5, though it's not very extreme because *lots* of evil things in fantasy continuua happen to look like Nazgul and 1:5 actually seems pretty defensible.

Reductionism isn't a party position where you have to argue against everything that sounds non-reductionist.  Harry has found himself in a universe where "reductionism" as a surface heuristic clearly applies more at some points than others.  Harry expects the eraser's underlying nature to remain atomic even in the face of magic, because scientists have already taken apart molecules in detail and magic doesn't change what they found.  Harry has no similar reason to Flat Earth Atheist a phoenix that nobody has yet taken apart.

I'd like to see your list of component pieces of evidence about Dementors and the likelihood ratios you assign to each element for Depression vs. Death/Mortality.  Offhand:

* Kiss 1:4
* flying corpse 1:5
* unkillable 1:4
* worst memories relived 4:1
* loss of happy memories 15:1
* chocolate treatment 5:1
* Patronus based on intense happy thoughts 4:1
* Protective Charm takes animal form 1:10

However, multiplying these all together is a horribly naive probability-theoretic error because what we really need is the probability of each observation, conditional on the basis hypothesis and all previous observations, e.g., the probability of chocolate treating the fear of mortality, *given that mortality causes review of worst memories*, is much higher than the probability of chocolate treating the fear of mortality; and the probability that Depression manifests as a flying corpse, *given that Depression destroys your soul*, is much higher than the probability of Depression manifesting as a flying corpse.  Running through it with conditional probabilities and doing it a bit more realistically, I'd get the successive probabilities for each piece of evidence given all the previous ones as maybe being:

* Prior 1:3 since Death/Mortality is a bigger / more powerful concept than Depression and more likely to get its own powerful magical species
* Kiss 1:4
* flying corpse 1:2
* unkillable 1:1.5
* worst memories relived 4:1
* and happy memories lost 4:1
* chocolate treatment 1.2:1
* Patronus based on intense happy thoughts 1.5:1
* Those happy thoughts take the shape of animals, not anything to do with the memory itself 1:10

Buuuut with likelihood ratios like that, we don't just blindly multiply them together, what we properly say is "What the hell?" or "The true explanation is not in our hypothesis set".  You shouldn't be finding half your evidence strongly pointing one way and half the evidence strongly pointing the other way.  So, if we're going to go on trying to be perhaps unduly realistic, we're clearly looking at a phenomenon that has properties of both death and depression simultaneously (i.e. J. K. Rowling was thinking about both, as clearly demonstrated by, y'know, the combination of the very clear Grim Reaper motif, and the chocolate cure).  The conditional dependencies on the first three items boil down to "If this is Depression, it's Depression symbolized by death" (supplying total likelihood of around 1:12 favoring Death, which seems like too little if we imagine the Depression:Death odds if these were our *only* three observations) and the conditional dependencies on the next four items boil down to "If this is Death, it's depressing Death" (supplying likelihood of 28:1 favoring Depression which sounds like I was too generous and devil's-advocating for these compared to the previous 1:12 and that I need to adjust this downward or rather adjust the other side upward but meh whatever).

What one should really do, but I'm just not going to bother doing, is start over again with the refined hypotheses for Dementors representing the abstract ideas "Depression is as terrible as death" versus "Death is depressing", and evaluate all the evidence seen in the light of each, and in this case we shouldn't end up with strong evidence pointing both ways.

If the first seven observations were the only observations, saying that the two hypotheses balance out seems pretty fair, or maybe it would legitimately skew toward Depression because Depression symbolized by death seems like it should cause selective rumination on worst memories more than Death being depressing seems like it should do that.

But the final item, which probably Rowling didn't even consciously intend, I would say is the key to the riddle if we take it at face value - the remaining piece of strong evidence that *discriminates* the two refined hypotheses.  Because the part where the happy thoughts come out as animals seems way more specific to "Death is depressing (and happy ignorance of mortality can ward that off)" than "Depression is as terrible as death (and cheerful-looking animal shapes can ward that off)".  Even if Rowling truly meant the second thing with no trace of the first, when it comes out as a magical riddle it points pretty darned strongly to Knowledge of Mortality.  And then maybe another factor of 1.2 or something for "The death of a loved one can alter your Patronus to look like their Patronus did", which seems weakly more aligned with death than depression though it's not very strongly predicted by either hypothesis.

Magic doesn't imply Jesus, but Harry has already at this point met Fawkes and been told that phoenixes are light, fire, healing, rebirth - he knows there are magic things that seem to represent ideas.

If we're going to be precise, then treated as a riddle, canon Dementors act like the projection of someone's fear of Mortality: *timor mortis conturbat me*.  They are flying corpses, they drain away happy thoughts, they drain away strength as they approach nearer, they are unkillable, if they Kiss you then this makes you Worse Than Dead even to those people who believe in an afterlife (that is, if you believe in an afterlife you might still be scared of the Dementor's Kiss in the same way non-afterlife-believers fear nonexistence), and the largest clue of all that distinguishes them from other possible horrors, the Dementors' aura can be temporarily fended off (but not destroyed) by happy thoughts in the shape of non-inexorable-mortality-approaching-aware animals.

The main characteristic for canon Dementors that seems more uniquely characteristic of Depression rather than Mortality is specifically "drains away happy thoughts, leaving person to review the worst memories of their life" and this could perhaps be read as Mortality's horror-aspect of "your life passing before your eyes" / "look back on your life and see what you did wrong, just before it ends", though this is a stretch; reliving worst memories are much *less* characteristic of Mortality-fear than ruminating on awful memories and forgetting happy ones is characteristic of Depression.  The focus that canon gives to the required happiness of the memory for the Patronus could also be taken as having a likelihood ratio favoring Depression rather than fear-of-Mortality.  Exposure being treatable with chocolate somewhat favors Depression over fear-of-Mortality.

The Patronus's manifestation as an animal seems to me to point extremely strongly toward Mortality as magical riddles go, but could potentially be rationalized as needing some good unreflective fun, or of animals not getting depressed due to lack of rumination abilities.  Still, ask yourself:  "As magical riddles go, are animals more famously immune to sadness or famously immune to the knowledge and fear of their own mortality?"  It would be around the same length of stretch as having the worst memories aspect be Mortality rather than Depression, I'd say.  You can separately try to rationalize the flying corpse as death being depressing, the unkillability as depression being resilient, and the Kiss as depression destroying the self.  But all of these nonetheless are *more* characteristic of Mortality, especially if taken as elements of a magical riddle.  Seeing a corpse is more likely to remind you of death than of how sad you are.  As magical riddles go, death is *more* famous for being invincible than Depression is for being invincible.  The erasure of mind and memory sounds more like an effect produced by the horror of nonexistence than of what depressed people fear will happen to them, where mind-destruction is only one of the forms the horror of Depression can take.  Even the flying, drifting aspect seems more like inexorable Death and its fear than like a projection of Depression.  And the thing where if your loved one dies, your Patronus can change to match their Patronus... how is that more closely associated with Depression than Mortality, exactly?  I agree it doesn't sound like a phenomenon that I would uniquely predict in advance based on the Mortality hypothesis, but it seems even less predicted on Depression - it is a mortality-associated phenomenon, not a depression-associated one.

The surrounding thermal cold seems about equally characteristic of Mortality and Depression.

Summing up all the pieces, the combination of animal-protection, flying corpsedom, unkillability, and Kiss seem to favor Mortality quite significantly over Depression, even taking the worst memories and chocolate into account.  Like, if you actually encounter canon Dementors, it seems more *surprising* for them to turn out to be Depression than to be Mortality, like in the former case you say "What?" and in the latter case you feel that the riddle was played straight.

"The Art of Rationality".  I have a book draft of it, but test readers agreed that it lacked the, for lack of a better word, Yudkowsky magic.  I forced myself to write it, more or less, and I suspect that the Yudkowsky magic went into HPMOR instead.

I still don't know how to write nonfiction, honestly.  I'm not sure anyone knows how to write nonfiction, which is why so much popular nonfiction adopts a narrative timeline that pretends to turn it into fiction instead.

It feels like we need separate collections for the "fic that is explicitly rationalfic" and "fic that felt rational to a lot of people on /r/rational".  I wouldn't mind seeing Time Braid in the latter.

I do anticipate that a lot of authors may not *like* having their work be called 'rationalfic' without being asked about that, which is why I feel like the first collection, "Rationalfic", should be mostly authors who've expressed approval of or inspiration by HPMOR, Luminosity, and the other seminal works.  Calling the second collection "/r/rational upvoted" is unambiguous, and kind to authors who may not approve of us (you can't control who upvotes you).

It seems to me inappropriate to take other people's fics and claim them as 'rationalfic' when they might well, for all we know, disagree; and more importantly, I think the sidebar of this reddit is just plain wrong and way too inclusive.  Rationalfic is (a) fic that was explicitly written in an attempt to be rationalfic or in a rationality-inspired way or (b) fic that focuses in on characters' thinking skills in a way that at least attempts, successfully or not, to transmit them to the reader.

This definition does appear to me to be perhaps less subject to acrimonious debates than the one that appears in the sidebar (we can ask the creator if they meant it as rationalfic), and also less subject to appropriating other people's stories under our own banner without asking them whether they like the label.

There's a standard Internet phenomenon (I generalize) of a Sneer Club of people who enjoy getting together and picking on designated targets.  Sneer Clubs (I expect) attract people with high Dark Triad characteristics, which is (I suspect) where Asshole Internet Atheists come from - if you get a club together for the purpose of sneering at religious people, it doesn't matter that God doesn't actually exist, the club attracts psychologically f'd-up people.  Bullies, in a word, people who are powerfully reinforced by getting in what feels like good hits on Designated Targets, in the company of others doing the same and congratulating each other on it.  E.g. my best guess is that RationalWiki started out as a Sneer Club targeted on homeopathy, and then they decided that since they were such funny and incisive skeptics they ought to branch out into writing about everything else, like the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Dark Lord Potter (I infer) aggregated as a Sneer Club targeted at Harry Potter fics they considered inferior, mated with a self-conceptualized elite fanfiction forum for properly dark, gritty, *adult* HP fics - the most elite HP forum on the Internet, or so they considered themselves.  HPMOR came along and was critically acclaimed by mainstream authors despite not (then) being dark and gritty, and it was by an outsider.  So the sneering club encountered something that seemed to threaten their status.  There is also a common attitude that nerds are designated bullying-targets; or to write it out at slightly greater length, people who talk about science are acting like they think they're snootier than you, which is especially deserving of a slapdown since the person is probably just some nerd in their mother's basement.

The result is not surprising.  It's basically the same reason RationalWiki went after LessWrong with "HP fic that mentions science like that makes it snooty" substituted for "skeptics who talk about probability theory like that makes them snooty".  I don't think this is complicated enough for me to need to write it out in Professor Quirrell's voice.

To be clear, there are all sorts of people in the world who legitimately don't enjoy Methods for any number of reasons, but if you want to understand the tone of the posts you see on DLP you'll do better if you understand the concept of a Sneer Club.  The natural response of a low-Dark-Triad non-bully who encounters HPMOR and doesn't enjoy it is to stop reading it, maybe with a small note of gratitude to the author for warning them in advance to give up if it wasn't fun by chapter ten.  To *hate hate hate* a vegetable stew and everyone who ever said they liked it, you need to have something else going on inside your head besides having tasted the stew and having said "bleah" that one time.

I think the problem is that Fiona, in some sense, has the least power compared to the problem she's trying to solve, which puts her in the most jeopardy and is a huge gravitational force attracting the story to her.  Same reason HPMOR's perspective shifted hard toward Hermione after Ch. 63; Harry had become too powerful post-63, and couldn't be the center of the story again until the threats had amped up far enough to balance, but the threats couldn't come out of thin air, so they had to develop out of the story, but the story couldn't center on Harry until the new threats appeared, etcetera.

(edited to make clear what this is all about)

Hi!  This is Eliezer Yudkowsky, original founder but no-longer-moderator of LessWrong.com and also by not-quite-coincidence the first AI In A Box Roleplayer Guy.  I am also the author of "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", a controversial fanfic which causes me to have a large, active Internet hatedom that does not abide by norms for reasoned discourse.  You should be very careful about believing any statement supposedly attributed to me that you have not seen directly on an account or page I directly control.

I was brought here by a debate in the comments about "Roko's Basilisk" mentioned in 1450's alt tag.  Roko's Basilisk is a weird concept which a *false* Internet meme says is believed on LessWrong.com and used to solicit donations (this has never happened on LessWrong.com or anywhere else, ever).  The meme that this is believed on LessWrong.com or used to solicit donations was spread by a man named David Gerard who made over 300 edits to the RationalWiki page on Roko's Basilisk, though the rest of RationalWiki does seem to have mostly gone along with it.

The tl;dr on Roko's Basilisk is that a sufficiently powerful AI will punish you if you did not help create it, in order to give you an incentive to create it.

RationalWiki basically invented Roko's Basilisk as a *meme* - not the original concept, but the meme that there's anyone out there who believes in Roko's Basilisk and goes around advocating that people should create AI to avoid punishment by it.  So far as I know, literally nobody has ever advocated this, ever.  Roko's original article basically said "And therefore you SHOULD NOT CREATE [particular type of AI that Yudkowsky described that has nothing to do with the Basilisk and would be particularly unlikely to create it even given other premises], look at what a DANGEROUS GUY Yudkowsky is for suggesting an AI that would torture people that didn't help create it" [it wouldn't].

In the hands of RationalWiki generally, and RationalWiki leader David Gerard particularly who also [wrote a wiki article smearing effective altruists that must be read to be believed](http://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Effective_altruism&amp;oldid=1316574), this somehow metamorphosed into a Singularity cult that tried to get people to believe a Pascal's Wager argument to donate to their AI god on pain of torture.  This cult that has literally never existed anywhere except in the imagination of David Gerard.

I'm a bit worried that the alt text of XKCD 1450 indicates that Randall Munroe thinks that there actually *are* "Roko's Basilisk people" somewhere and that there's fun to be had in mocking them (another key part of the meme RationalWiki spreads), but this is an understandable mistake since Gerard et. al. have more time on their hands and have conducted a quite successful propaganda war.  With tacit cooperation from a Slate reporter who took everything in the RationalWiki article at face value, didn't contact me or anyone else who could have said otherwise, and engaged in that particular bit of motivated credulity to use in a drive-by shooting attack on Peter Thiel who was heavily implied to be funding AI work because of Basilisk arguments; to the best of my knowledge Thiel has never said anything about Roko's Basilisk, ever, and I have no positive indication that Thiel has ever heard of it, and he was funding AI work long long before then, etcetera.  And then of course it was something the mainstream media had reported on and that was the story.  I mention this to explain why it's understandable that Munroe might have bought into the Internet legend that there are "Roko's Basilisk people" since RationalWiki won the propaganda war to the extent of being picked up by a Slate reporter that further propagated the story widely.  But it's still, you know, disheartening.

It violates discourse norms to say things like the above without pointing out specific factual errors being made by RationalWiki, which I will now do.  Checking the current version of the Roko's Basilisk article on RationalWiki, virtually everything in the first paragraph is mistaken, as follows:

&gt; Roko's basilisk is a proposition that says an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future may retroactively punish those who did not assist in bringing about its existence.

Roko's basilisk was the proposition that a self-improving AI that was sufficiently powerful could do this; all-powerful is not required.  Note hyperbole.

&gt; It resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager; an argument used to try and suggest people should subscribe to particular singularitarian ideas, or even donate money to them, by weighing up the prospect of punishment versus reward. 

**This sentence is a lie**, originated and honed by RationalWiki with the deliberate attempt to smear the reputation of what, I don't know, Gerard sees as an online competitor or something.  Nobody ever said "Donate so the AI we build won't torture you."  I mean, who the bleep would think that would work even if they believed in the Basilisk thing?  Gerard made this up.

&gt; Furthermore, the proposition says that merely knowing about it incurs the risk of punishment. 

This is a bastardization of work that I and some other researchers did on Newcomblike reasoning in which, e.g., we proved mutual cooperation on the oneshot Prisoner's Dilemma between agents that possess each other's source code and are simultaneously trying to prove theorems about each other's behavior.  See http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5577  The basic adaptation to Roko's Basilisk as an infohazard is that if you're not even thinking about the AI at all, it can't see a dependency of your behavior on its behavior because you won't have its source code if you're not thinking about it at all.  This doesn't mean if you are thinking about it, it will get you; I mean it's not like you could prove things about an enormous complicated AI even if you did have the source code, and it has a resource-saving incentive to do the equivalent of "defecting" by making you believe that it will torture you and then not bothering to actually carry out the threat.  Cooperation on the Prisoner's Dilemma via source code simulation isn't easy to obtain, it would be easy for either party to break if they wanted, and it's only the common benefit of cooperation that establishes a motive for rational agents to preserve the delicate conditions for mutual cooperation on the PD.  There's no motive on your end to carefully carry out necessary conditions to be blackmailed.  (But taking Roko's premises at face value, his idea would zap people as soon as they read it.  Which - keeping in mind that at the time I had absolutely no idea this would all blow up the way it did - caused me to yell quite loudly at Roko for violating ethics given his own premises, I mean really, WTF?  You're going to get everyone who reads your article tortured so that you can argue against an AI proposal?   In the twisted alternate reality of RationalWiki, this became proof that I believed in Roko's Basilisk, since I yelled at the person who invented it without including twenty lines of disclaimers about what I didn't necessarily believe.   And since I had no idea this would blow up that way at the time, I suppose you could even read the sentences I wrote that way, which I did not edit for hours first because I had no idea this was going to haunt me for years to come.  And then, since Roko's Basilisk was a putatively a pure infohazard of no conceivable use or good to anyone, and since I didn't really want to deal with the argument, I deleted it from LessWrong which seemed to me like a perfectly good general procedure for dealing with putative pure infohazards that jerkwads were waving in people's faces.  Which brought out the censorship!! trolls and was certainly, in retrospect, a mistake.)

&gt; It is also mixed with the ontological argument, to suggest this is even a reasonable threat. 

I have no idea what "ontological argument" is supposed to mean here.  If it's the ontological argument from theology, as was linked, then this part seems to have been made up from thin air.  I have never heard the ontological argument associated with anything in this sphere, except on this RationalWiki article itself.

&gt; It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who most clearly described it (though he did not originate it).

Roko did in fact originate it. Also, anyone can sign up for LessWrong.com, David Gerard has an account there but that doesn't make him a "member of the rationalist community".

And that is just the opening paragraph.

I'm a bit sad that Randall Monroe seems to possibly have jumped on this bandwagon - since it was started by people who were playing the role of jocks sneering at nerds, the way they also sneer at effective altruists, and having XKCD join in on that feels very much like your own mother joining the gang hitting you with baseball bats.  On the other hand, RationalWiki has conducted a very successful propaganda campaign here.  So it's saddening but not too surprising if Randall Monroe has never heard hinted any version but RationalWiki's.  I hope he reads this and reconsiders.

Do we know what happens if someone tries to ascend to godhood who is not a giant dick and would actually be pretty nice to humanity and Alaya and, hell, Gaia (move all the humans off the planet)?  Does the Counter Force still slap them down?  I mean, have we ever seen or heard about anyone trying that in-verse?

Step one:  "Dear Alaya, I would like to engage in a godhood project of mutual benefit.  If you would rather not have me embark on this current project, please have the Counter Force make this die come up sixes six times..."

I laughed, but in all honesty, that scenario is significantly under my cognitive complexity limit.

&gt; How is continuity of consciousness preserved in cryonics?

Because you can actually read out the brain's pattern which you can't do with ashes, and, in my expectation, also can't do with public-record facts about the cremated person.  New tech without time travel isn't going to restore information that has been thermodynamically destroyed.  Nonlocal causality as of time travel or a time camera goes against the perfectly local character of physical laws as we have comprehended them to date and seems plausibly baked into the nature of physical reality, so I call time travel 'impossible' pending very surprising revelations about the universe.

Your ignorance of the difference does not mean that there is no difference or even that you don't know there is a difference.  I know the abstract fact that if all available info is used to bring back someone I can't distinguish from my memories of my great-grandmother, that there will be many differences from my actual great-grandmother (even though I don't know what those differences are) and that my original great-grandmother's continuity of consciousness will have been lost.  To put it another way, if you know you're about to be cremated and then replaced by someone who is consistent with all your friends' memories of you, you should anticipate dying and being replaced by someone who will lack most of your memories, have a significantly different personality that is just a random personality consistent with the outward way you act or anything you wrote down, etcetera.

&gt; It's kind of a naive question, but: after the singularity happens, would it be possible to simulate from the beginning of the universe up to the point of the singularity and rescue everyone that died?

No.  You could simulate another world and rescue all the people in it who died, but that world would not be *this* world---we don't have the info for that, and knowing the laws of physics doesn't tell us how to locate ourselves within spatial infinity and all the Everett branches.  There is more than one past that could have given rise to this future; when you cremate a person, there is more than one person who, cremated, could have given rise to those ashes.  This is in fact the very definition of death---that it is no longer possible to unambigiuously nail down the pattern of your mind, making it impossible to restore it.

So Eliezer!Quirrell sits down and makes a list of all the background plots *he* could think up, then checks everything he's ever observed to see if it distinguishes among them.  An entire world leaves a lot of evidence, and the Eliezer!author's thoughts will be somewhere on Eliezer!Quirrell's list, because I'm not going to think up a plot unimaginable to a character exactly as smart as I am - not without abandoning coherence entirely, which would be bad literature.  The real Eliezer can hold Harry and Quirrell and Dumbledore's entire souls in his mind at the same time; Eliezer!Quirrell is not going to be confused by their distance from him.

&gt; It's like going to a library, and when you walk in the doors, everyone looks at you, staring.  Then you walk over to a certain row of bookcases—say, you're looking for books on writing—and at once several others, walking with stiff, exaggerated movements, select a different stack to read in.  When you reach the bookshelves for Dewey decimal 808, there are several other people present, taking quick glances out of the corner of their eye while pretending not to look at you.  You take out a copy of The Poem's Heartbeat: A Manual of Prosody.

&gt; At once one of the others present reaches toward a different bookcase and proclaims, "I'm not reading The Poem's Heartbeat!  In fact, I'm not reading anything about poetry!  I'm reading The Elements of Style, which is much more widely recommended by many mainstream writers."  Another steps in your direction and nonchalantly takes out a second copy of The Poem's Heartbeat, saying, "I'm not reading this book just because you're reading it, you know; I think it's a genuinely good book, myself."

It's easy to convert a halting oracle to run any finite computation immediately.  Let's say the output is 20 bits long.  First, ask whether the program that computes the first bit of the output, and runs forever if that bit is 0, else halts, halts, etc.

I do not know of anything productive to humanity's situation to do with an infinitely powerful but slow computing device.  If it were faster, one could maybe use it to make money on the stock market and use that to do something productive.

This seems mostly equivalent to the standing problem, "What the hell do you actually do with an Oracle that gets humanity out of its trouble?"

You are correct that this is about what HJPEV would do.  Unfortunately, that's very far short of what Eliezer Yudkowsky would do, even if Friendly AI were not an option.  E.g. a couple of million dollars per year and Google's reputation, correctly deployed, could make a tremendous difference to popularizing and deploying cryonics, and that isn't even in the top 5 most important interventions, just one of the easiest to remark on immediately (you did request war on death, and if you only fight cancer that just means you die of something else).  From my perspective, events like these are just associated with a distant sadness---I know they're doing maybe 2% of what they could, and will almost certainly never do any better.

I was genuinely shocked by the reader response to the section you quoted.  I guess to me it seems obvious that just because Harry produces what he considers to be a shallow quote, there's no way Dumbledore has of knowing what test Harry is trying to do, and certainly the canon Dumbledore would agree if he didn't know why Harry was saying that, and so might a lot of other people depending on what 'wisdom' is taken to mean.  Did you also balk at this section of Ch. 63?

---
Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore:

It might have been only fifty-seven seconds before breakfast ended and he might have needed four twists of his Time-Turner, but in the end, Albus Dumbledore did make it.

"Headmaster?" squeaked the polite voice of Professor Filius Flitwick, as the old wizard passed him by on his way to his seat. "Mr. Potter left a message for you."

The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly at the Charms Professor.

"Mr. Potter said that after he woke up, he realized how unfair had been the things he said to you after Fawkes screamed. Mr. Potter said that he wasn't saying anything about anything else, just apologizing for that one part."

The old wizard kept looking at his Charms Professor, and still did not speak.

"Headmaster?" squeaked Filius.

"Tell him I said thank you," said Albus Dumbledore, "but that it is wiser to listen to phoenixes than to wise old wizards," and sat down at his place three seconds before all the food vanished.
---

---

If, seeing from inside Dumbledore's perspective there, you didn't jump up and say, "Haha!  Only a fool would think that the phoenix's scream was more important than wisdom!" then you have no cause to expect Dumbledore to have that inward reaction in Ch. 39 either.

To me it feels like saying 'Oh, Dumbledore's not actually that easily fooled' by "Love is more important than wisdom" implies that some sort of 'fooled' is going on in the first place.  Just because Harry privately devised a test that he privately imagines Dumbledore to have failed, doesn't mean that Dumbledore inhabits a mental world where anything like that ever happened; from Dumbledore's perspective his agreement just carries pretty much the same meaning as his statement in Ch. 63.  (The same meaning *Harry* invokes in Ch. 62 when he suggests that maybe the phoenixes, who are just magical animals, are thereby smarter than us because they don't come up with complicated clever reasons for not taking the prisoners out of their cells.)  It feels to me like many readers are thinking as if all of Harry's info ought to be known to Dumbledore, or like they're only modeling one mental world themselves and it's Harry's world and therefore they expect that same world to have been inhabited by Dumbledore, or something...?

If it's okay to start out with that as the setting, then:

 _Aristoi_ by Walter John Williams goes on the list.  Possibly Greg Egan novels although only _Permutation City_ and _Quarantine_ seem to me to be really good and they aren't set in happyland.  _The Golden Age_ by John C. Wright, but the sequels suck.  Many different novels by Peter F. Hamilton.

Stories where the protagonists win sufficiently hard?  I'm having a hard time thinking of a single one.  Some of Alicorn's writing maybe.

Let me start by asking a simpler question: Where is the literary fiction that is unabashed about its ideals?  Which, instead of being about broken people becoming more broken, is about good people becoming better people?  Which pits good vs. good instead of evil vs. evil and manages to show both sides in the best light, instead of needing to show them as being tainted?  This is what I would expect from a literary writer who was not merely pretending to be wise, who wanted to probe deep enough to find questions that would genuinely confuse and divide their own audience rather than lead them by the hand to a foregone conclusion.  But then perhaps that literature would not pass the gatekeepers who were pretending to be wise and who deeply feared that someone else might think them not cynical and sophisticated enough.

But if you can't find literary fiction with untainted ideals and good people becoming better, how will you ever find any rational literary fiction?  Mastering the art of probability theory is just one kind of ideal, and if all you can do with ideals is show them to be tainted, you're not going to teach anyone much about how to reckon falsifiability.  And if you want to say anything more about sanity than yelling at the reader about God not existing, then you had better start from a reasonably okay rationalist to start with and show them getting better, and be able to show two ideals of rationality in opposition (without pretending them to be tainted or hypocritical, without making yourself out to be superior to either one).

The qualities of serious literature are a prerequisite to serious rational literature.  But I do fear that the qualities of serious literature are also very much opposed to the conceits of those who imagine themselves the gatekeepers of their tiny, dying audience.

This same issue bugged me too, and I agree.  The only way a caveperson can make an LED flashlight out of flint in a week, and then nobody else can learn to do the same by copying every motion, and only that caveperson can maintain it, is if their shard is fiddling with the input materials to duplicate the actual stored blueprint.  Then some tinkertech would be duplicable by our tech base, but not much---which is just what we observe!

Anissimov did not advocate these ideas while he was working for us, let alone use MIRI resources to do so (that would have been grounds for immediate termination).  I'm not sure a corporation even has a legal right to make employment dependent on what people say in their off hours (I am not a lawyer).  I certainly decline to take responsibility for what they say after they've been terminated.  Anissimov was never any kind of founder of MIRI, just someone we employed for a few years to do writing, and we have never parented any of these kinds of ideas or deployed any resources to support them nor has our actual leadership ever endorsed them or supported their development even in a personal capacity etcetera.  If I could press a magic button to shut down 'More Right' I would certainly do so.  I think that's all the sane people would want me to say on this subject.

I was assuming independent development of writing utensils that can draw in any color desired, followed by white boards to draw on, *since wizards have been a magical literate society for literally centuries and they do invent their own gadgets*.

I should probably have her be described as holding something other than a marker, though Harry would indeed tend to think of it that way.  Like a short rod, or a thick quill, or inky chalk, or something.

How on Earth are people even reading this?  It's not on my current website, it was taken down long ago from the website I had before that, it was first written when I was, what, seventeen or nineteen years old?  (I don't remember exactly.)  When I was 13 years old I was writing horrible Barney the Dinosaur fanfiction and posting it to alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die, which also is not representative of my current opinions at age 35.  Who is publishing this stuff and circulating it?  I'm going to guess the Internet trolls at the so-called 'RationalWiki'.  Whoever it was, that they didn't bother to attach a disclaimer about my age at the time, and my explicit disavowals since then, tells you everything you need to know about their intellectual integrity.

Please be aware that I have a huge Internet hatedom that does not abide by commonly accepted practices for reasonable debate.  **If it's not on yudkowsky.net or a post on an account you're sure I control** (taking into account fake Twitter accounts spoofing me and so on), **do not trust the alleged quote or opinion**, including alleged 'opinions of Yudkowsky' that they seem to be arguing against.  RationalWiki is especially egregious about this, but they have many imitators.  *If it's not in a paper or essay with a date after 2002, on a site controlled by me or by a reputable academic source*, do *not* try to get your idea of any facts, opinions, or views allegedly promoted by Eliezer Yudkowsky from non-original sources!  This is a pretty good precaution in any case, and a better precaution when views are controversial, and a *mandatory* precaution when someone has a large Internet hatedom that does not abide by netiquette or sanity.

That was planned, I simply couldn't get the writing correct on the first pass, and also didn't want to leave it on quite that hard an end note for several months, so I wrote a really quick interim ending and substituted the true one later.  There was a posting schedule I had to keep because I was leaving somewhere (IIRC), so I only had limited time to write the last chapter and I started posting the first one (also due to a schedule) before the last one had been fully written.

Owning up to this doesn't make it sense.

The narrator sees all, and does not lie.  Except for that one clearly marked time that Draco's memories are in italics and it is shown to be a False Memory Charm immediately afterward.  The story is not solvable if you cannot trust the narrator.

"Strong evidence" is something you are very unlikely to see in the (probable) cases where the theory is false.

"Evidence" is something you are more likely to see if the theory is true than if it is false.

"Weak evidence" is something you are only slightly more likely to see if the theory is true than if it is false.

David Gerard said:

&gt; &gt; and the associated lies are RationalWiki

&gt; You've claimed lies and been unable to back up said claim when called on it before. Now, this will be the fourth time I've asked and you haven't answered: What is a lie in the article?

I reply each time, though the fact that it's a Wiki makes it a moving target.

Today the *first* false statement I encountered is in the opening paragraph and it is:

&gt; It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who most clearly described it (though he did not originate it).

Roko did in fact originate it, or at least independently invented it and introduced it to the 'Net.

However this is not obviously a malicious lie, so I will keep reading.

First false statement *that seems either malicious or willfully ignorant:*

&gt; In LessWrong's Timeless Decision Theory (TDT),[3] punishment of a copy or simulation of oneself is taken to be punishment of your own actual self

TDT is a decision theory and is completely agnostic about anthropics, simulation arguments, pattern identity of consciousness, or utility.  For its actual contents see http://intelligence.org/files/Comparison.pdf or http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Hintze-Problem-class-dominance-in-predictive-dilemmas.pdf and note the *total lack* of any discussion of what a philosopher would call pattern theories of identity, there or in any other paper discussing that class of logical decision theories.  It's just a completely orthogonal issue that has as much to do with TDT or Updateless Decision Theory (the theory we actually use these days) as the price of fish in Iceland.

EDIT:  Actually I didn't read carefully enough.  The first malicious lie is here:

&gt; an argument used to try and suggest people should subscribe to particular singularitarian ideas, or even donate money to them, by weighing up the prospect of punishment versus reward

**Neither Roko, nor anyone else I know about, ever tried to use this as an argument to persuade anyone that they should donate money.**  Roko's original argument was, "CEV-based Friendly AI might do this so we should never build CEV-based Friendly AI", that is, an argument *against* donating to MIRI.  Which is transparently silly because to whatever extent you credit the argument it instantly generalizes beyond FAI and indeed FAI is exactly the kind of AI that would *not* do it.  Regardless, *nobody ever used this to try to argue for actually donating money to MIRI, not EVER that I've ever heard of.*  This is perhaps THE primary lie that RationalWiki crafted and originated in their systematic misrepresentation of the subject; I'm so used to RationalWiki telling this lie that I managed not to notice it on this read-through on the first scan.

This has been today's lie in a RationalWiki article!  Tune in the next time David Gerard claims that I don't back up my claims!  I next expect David Gerard to claim that what he really means is that Gerard does see my reply each time and then doesn't *agree* that RationalWiki's statements are lies, but what Gerard says ("you haven't answered") sure sounds like I don't respond at all, right?  And just not agreeing with my reply, and then calling that a lack of answer, is kind of cheap, don't you think?  So that's yet another lie---a deliberate misrepresentation which is literally false and which the speaker knows will create false beliefs in the reader's mind---right there in the question!  Stay classy, RationalWiki!  When you're tired of uninformed mockery and lies about math papers you don't understand, maybe you can make some more fun of people sending anti-malarial bednets to Africa and call them "assholes" again![1]

[1]  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Effective_altruism - a grimly amusing read if you have any prior idea of what effective altruism is actually like, and can appreciate why self-important Internet trolls would want to elevate their own terribly, terribly important rebellion against the system (angry blog posts?) above donating 10% of your income to charity, working hard to figure out which charities are actually most effective, sending bednets to Africa, etcetera.  Otherwise, for the love of God don't start at RationalWiki.  Never learn about *anything* from RationalWiki first.  Learn about it someplace real, then read the RationalWiki take on it to learn why you should never visit RationalWiki again.

David Gerard is apparently one of the foundation directors of RationalWiki, so one of the head trolls; also the person who wrote the first version of their nasty uninformed article on effective altruism.  He is moderately skilled at sounding reasonable when he is not calling people who donate 10% of their income to sending bednets to Africa "assholes" in an online wiki.  I don't recommend believing anything David Gerard says, or implies, or believing that the position he seems to be arguing against is what the other person actually believes, etcetera.  It is safe to describe David Gerard as a lying liar whose pants are not only undergoing chemical combustion but possibly some sort of exoergic nuclear reaction.

Okay.  It is a falsehood to intimate that either Thiel or Kurzweil take the Basilisk seriously.  It is to the best of my knowledge a falsehood to intimate that any rich and powerful person takes it seriously; I know of no such person.  If you want to trash somebody's reputation for the crime of idiocy, go after me, I was the one who was an idiot.  Don't go after half of Silicon Valley.

I do not expect that Slate is in the business of withdrawing sensationalist false implications, and my prior expectation is that your process for withdrawing outright falsehoods is laughable to the point of deserving no investment of effort on my part.  In the event that the article is significantly and publicly revised, however, I will reconsider a number of negative opinions about you and your magazine and will be happy to talk further.  If you want to give me a link to a reporting mechanism, I'll try it and see what happens---though I find your implication that you, personally, are not the one responsible for revising falsehoods to be a bit eyebrow-raising already.  I have trouble believing that you can't correct the article yourself if you want to, and if you don't, I am very skeptical of any purported ethical theory of journalism which claims that you are not responsible for that.

And please don't try to pin the blame on Gary Drescher; it does you no credit.  Drescher has never written or said anything about the Basilisk that I know about.  His having previously written about Newcomblike decision problems, along with hundreds of other researchers, places him under no obligation to risk writing back to a journalist writing about a sensationalist and potentially reputation-damaging topic.

I'm interested to know that if I want to write an unsigned online smear piece on someone, like "John Doe: Terrible Science Reporter, by Anonymous", all I need to do is trawl that person's entire online life history (yes, RationalWiki does this to me) and select a few choice quotes that make the target sound hostile.  And then no journalist will contact the target to check the facts, because he sounds hostile in the quotes.  Brilliant!  Foolproof!  Only... wait, what if it's not foolproof?  What if a competent journalist would just *contact the primary source anyway?*  What if they're actually aware what selective presentation can do to an arbitrary target, due to having seen it done a hundred times before over their journalistic careers, and so they don't trust the unsigned online smear piece's selection of data?  Hm, I'm not sure this plan is as clever as it first sounds.

Yes, now that I think about it... It only works on a certain type of journalist, one who doesn't care very much about being 'fooled' by the online smear piece if he gets his own sensationalist story where he can spread the smear around on what he considers high-value targets that nobody can *prove* didn't hear about the idea once and believe it, even though there's no visible sign that this ever happened, and the priors are against that second part, and you might as well make the same implication about Whoopi Goldberg as long as we're just making stuff up out of thin air.  Also you secretly believe in Scientology (can't disprove it! woohoo! that's enough to publish in Slate! try our retraction process if you think it's false!).  But I digress; tell me more about what you consider to be journalistic integrity, Mr. Auerbach.

What's the truth about Roko's Basilisk?  The truth is that making something like this "work", in the sense of managing to think a thought that would actually give future superintelligences an incentive to hurt you, would require overcoming what seem to me like some pretty huge obstacles.  

The most blatant obstacle to Roko's Basilisk is, intuitively, that there's no incentive for a future agent to follow through with the threat in the future, because by doing so it just expends resources at no gain to itself.  We can formalize that using classical causal decision theory, which is the academically standard decision theory: following through on a blackmail threat, in the future after the past has already taken place, cannot (from the blackmailing agent's perspective) be the physical cause of improved outcomes in the past, because the future cannot be the cause of the past. 

But classical causal decision theory isn't the only decision theory that has ever been invented, and if you were to read up on the academic literature, you would find a lot of challenges to the assertion that, e.g., two rational agents always defect against each other in the one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma.  One of those challenges was a theory of my own invention, which is why this whole fiasco took place on LessWrong.com in the first place.  (I feel rather like the speaker of that ancient quote, "All my father ever wanted was to make a toaster you could really set the darkness on, and you perverted his work into these horrible machines!")  But there have actually been a lot of challenges like that in the literature, not just mine, as anyone actually investigating would have discovered.  Lots of people are uncomfortable with the notion that rational agents always defect in the oneshot Prisoner's Dilemma.  And if you formalize blackmail, including this case of blackmail, the same way, then most challenges to mutual defection in the Prisoner's Dilemma are also implicitly challenges to the first obvious reason why Roko's Basilisk would never work.

But there are also other obstacles.  The decision theory I proposed back in the day says that you have to know certain things about the other agent in order to achieve mutual cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, and that's with both parties *trying* to set up a situation which leads to mutual cooperation instead of mutual defection.  As I presently understand the situation, there is literally nobody on Earth, including me, who has the knowledge needed to set themselves up to be blackmailed if they were deliberately trying to make that happen.  Any potentially blackmailing AI would much prefer to have you *believe* that it is blackmailing you, without actually expending resources on following through with the blackmail, insofar as they think they can exert any control on you at all via an exotic decision theory.  Just like in the oneshot Prisoner's Dilemma the "ideal" outcome is for the other player to believe you are modeling them and will cooperate if and only if they cooperate, and so they cooperate, but then actually you just defect anyway.  For the other player to be confident this will not happen in the Prisoner's Dilemma, for them to expect you not to sneakily defect anyway, they must have some very strong knowledge about you.  In the case of Roko's Basilisk, "defection" corresponds to *not* actually torturing anyone, *not* expending resources on that, and just letting them *believe* that you will blackmail them.  Two AI agents with sufficiently strong knowledge of each other, and heavily motivated to achieve mutual cooperation on the Prisoner's Dilemma, might be able to overcome this obstacle and cooperate with confidence.  But why would you put in that degree of effort----if you even could, which I don't think you as a human can---in order to give a blackmailing agent an incentive to actually carry through on its threats?

I have written the above with some reluctance, because even if I don't yet see a way to repair this obstacle myself, somebody else might see how to repair it now that I've said what it is.  Which is not a good general procedure for handling infohazards; people with expert knowledge on them should, obviously, as a matter of professional ethics, just never discuss them at all, including describing why a particular proposal doesn't work, just in case there's some unforeseen clever way to repair the proposal.  There are other obstacles here which I am not discussing, just in case the logic I described above has a flaw.  Nonetheless, so far as I know, Roko's Basilisk does not work, nobody has actually been bitten by it, and everything I have done was in the service of what I thought was the obvious Good General Procedure for Handling Potential Infohazards, though I was very naive about the Streisand Effect, very naive in thinking that certain others would comprehend the Good General Procedure for Handling Potential Infohazards, and genuinely emotionally shocked by the degree to which it was seized upon as a chance for a good sneer, to the point that a publication like Slate is outright calling it a "referendum on autism" in those literal exact words.

It goes without saying that neither I, nor any other person with enough knowledge to see it in terms of "Hm, math plus empirical question, does this actually work or can it be made to work?... probably not but it's hard to be absolutely sure because I can't think of everything on the spot", nor any of the people who ever worried on a less informed basis that it might be a threat, nor any of the quiet good ordinary people of LessWrong, have ever spread or sought to spread this concept, as secret doctrine or public doctrine or in any other way, nor advocate it as a pretext for any action or belief.  It is *solely* spread on the Internet by the various trolls, both unemployed and employed, who see it as an excuse for a good sneer to assert that someone else believes in it.  The people who propagate the tale of Roko's Basilisk and the associated lies are RationalWiki which hates hates hates LessWrong, journalists setting out to smear designated targets in Silicon Valley by association, and the many fine sneerers of the Internet.  They said it, not us; they are the one to whom the idea appeals, not us; they are the ones, not us, for whom it holds such a strange fascination---though that fascination, alas, is only the fascination of the really good sneer on the allowed target.  It is a strange supposedly religious doctrine whose existence is supported *only* by those looking to put down those who allegedly believe it, and not at all by the alleged believers, looking on with weary shrugs.  This is readily verified with some googling.

And I expect it is probably futile in the end to ever try to set the record straight, when there are people who so very much enjoy a good sneer, and sad excuses for journalists are willing to get that sneer off Internet wikis with an obvious axe to grind, and are strangely reluctant to fire off a query email toward the target of their laughter.

And I write this in full knowledge that it will not stop, that nothing can possibly stop, someone who enjoys a good sneer.  That I could sit here citing the last forty years of literature on Newcomblike problems to absolutely no effect, and they would just be, "hur hur AI devil god hur hur he thinks he can math talk hur hur butthurt hur hur nerds believe in science fiction hur hur you aren't mocking this idea that seems really mockable so you must not be part of my high-school-jock hyena-pack and that equals mockery-target yay now I get to mock you too".

And having previously devoted large parts of my life to explaining certain bits of math and science in more accessible terms (e.g. my introduction to Bayes's Theorem, or my Cartoon Guide to Lob's Theorem), like my childhood role model Richard Feynman, I now understand, very sadly, why so many academics choose to retreat behind technical language in papers that only other academics are supposed to read.

But that, for the record, is what actually happened.

What you know:  When Roko posted about the Basilisk, I very foolishly yelled at him, called him an idiot, and then deleted the post.

Why I did that is not something you have direct access to, and thus you should be careful about Making Stuff Up, especially when there are Internet trolls who are happy to tell you in a loud authoritative voice what I was thinking, despite having never passed anything even close to an Ideological Turing Test on Eliezer Yudkowsky.

Why I yelled at Roko:  Because I was caught flatfooted in surprise, because I was indignant to the point of genuine emotional shock, at the concept that somebody who thought they'd invented a brilliant idea that would cause future AIs to torture people who had the thought, had promptly posted it to the public Internet.  In the course of yelling at Roko to explain why ths was a bad thing, I made the further error---keeping in mind that I had *absolutely no idea* that *any* of this would ever blow up the way it did, if I had I would obviously have kept my fingers quiescent---of not making it absolutely clear using lengthy disclaimers that my yelling did not mean that I believed Roko was right about CEV-based agents torturing people who had heard about Roko's idea.  It was obvious to me that no CEV-based agent would ever do that and equally obvious to me that the part about CEV was just a red herring; I more or less automatically pruned it from my processing of the suggestion and automatically generalized it to cover the entire class of similar scenarios and variants, variants which I considered obvious despite significant divergences (I forgot that other people were not professionals in the field).  This class of all possible variants did strike me as potentially dangerous as a collective group, even though it did not occur to me that Roko's original scenario might be right---that was obviously wrong, so my brain automatically generalized it.

At this point we start to deal with a massive divergence between what I, and several other people on LessWrong, considered to be obvious common sense, and what other people did not consider to be obvious common sense, and the malicious interference of the Internet trolls at RationalWiki.

What I considered to be obvious common sense was that you did not spread potential information hazards because it would be a crappy thing to do to someone.  The problem wasn't Roko's post itself, about CEV, being correct.  That thought never occurred to me for a fraction of a second.  The problem was that Roko's post seemed near in idea-space to a large class of potential hazards, all of which, regardless of their plausibility, had the property that they presented *no potential benefit to anyone*.  They were *pure* infohazards.  The *only* thing they could possibly do was be detrimental to brains that represented them, if one of the possible variants of the idea turned out to be repairable of the obvious objections and defeaters.  So I deleted it, because on my worldview there was no reason *not* to.  I did not want LessWrong.com to be a place where people were exposed to potential infohazards because somebody like me thought they were being clever about reasoning that they probably weren't infohazards.  On my view, the key fact about Roko's Basilisk wasn't that it was plausible, or implausible, the key fact was just that shoving it in people's faces seemed like a fundamentally crap thing to do because there was *no upside.*

Again, I deleted that post not because I had decided that this thing probably presented a real hazard, but because I was afraid some unknown variant of it might, and because it seemed to me like the obvious General Procedure For Handling Things That Might Be Infohazards said you shouldn't post them to the Internet.  If you look at the original SF story where the term "basilisk" was coined, it's about a mind-erasing image and the.... trolls, I guess, though the story predates modern trolling, who go around spraypainting the Basilisk on walls, using computer guidance so they don't know themselves what the Basilisk looks like, in hopes the Basilisk will erase some innocent mind, for the lulz.  These people are the villains of the story.  The good guys, of course, try to erase the Basilisk from the walls.  Painting Basilisks on walls is a crap thing to do.  Since there was no upside to being exposed to Roko's Basilisk, its probability of being true was irrelevant.  And Roko himself had thought this was a thing that might actually work.  So I yelled at Roko for violating basic sanity about infohazards for stupid reasons, and then deleted the post.  He, by his own lights, had violated the obvious code for the ethical handling of infohazards, conditional on such things existing, and I was indignant about this.  Am I getting through here at all?

If I had to state the basic quality of this situation which I overlooked, it wouldn't so much be the Streisand Effect as the existence of a large fraction of humanity---thankfully not the whole species---that really really wants to sneer at people, and which will distort the facts as they please if it gives them a chance for a really good sneer.  Especially if the targets can be made to look like nice bully-victims.  Then the sneering is especially fun.  To a large fraction of the Internet, targets who are overly intelleshual, or targets who go around talking using big words when they aren't official licensed Harvard professors, or targets who seem like they take all that sciunce ficshun stuff seriously, seem like especially nice bully-victims.

Interpreting my deleting the post as uncritical belief in its contents let people get in a really good sneer at the fools who, haha, believed that their devil god would punish the unbelievers by going backward in time.  RationalWiki were the worst offenders and distorters here, but I do think that the more recent coverage by Dave Auerbach deserves a bonus award for entirely failing to ask me or contact me in any way (wonderful coverage, Slate! I'm glad your intrepid reporters are able to uncritically report everything they read on an Internet wiki with an obvious axe to grind! primary sources, who needs them?).  Auerbach also referred to the affair as a "referendum on autism"---I'm sort of aghast that Slate actually prints things like that, but it makes pretty clear what I was saying earlier about people distorting the truth as much as they please, in the service of a really good sneer; and about some parts of the Internet thinking that, say, autistic people, are designated sneering-victims to the point where you can say that outright and that's fine.  To make a display of power requires a victim to crush beneath you, after all, and it's interesting what some people think are society's designated victims.  (You especially have to love the way Auerbach goes out of his way to claim, falsely, that the victims are rich and powerful, just in case you might otherwise be tempted to feel some sympathy.  Nothing provokes indignation in a high school jock like the possibility that the Designated Victims might rise above their proper place and enjoy some success in life, a process which is now occurring to much of Silicon Valley as the Sneerers suddenly decide that Google is a target, and which Auerbach goes out of his way to invoke.  Nonetheless, I rent a room in a group house in Berkeley; working for an academic nonprofit doesn't pay big bucks by Bay Area living standards.)

And if you'd linked to the original article and posted that as your commentary, instead of not linking the original and then going "ha ha how stupid", I would have replied in kind.  It skills not to complain that the original article, aimed at a popular audience, didn't spell out "Cromwell's Rule for logical uncertainty"; when we apply *scorn* to a statement, especially without linking to a fuller explanation, it implies a judgment on our part that the author could not possibly have meant anything sensible and that it is time to terminate the investigation.  If it turns out as a practical truth that the author actually did mean something sensible after all, especially when the author was originally trying to say something about probability theory rather than UFOs, it's time to recalibrate your sense of scorn and how early it goes off.  Let us leave this aside for now.

There's three obvious possibilities for how we might construct a bounded rational agent which does not in fact have probability literally zero of making any given logic error (because all the transistors quantum-jumped to different states, etcetera) on any given intermediate step of a calculation.

First, the agent could discard consideration of such possibilities because they are so extremely improbable that the cost to think about them exceeds any expected value of thinking about them.  (But perhaps the most efficient calculation is one which uses more error-prone transistors and proves incorrect theorems more often in a system designed to be robust to incorrect theorems because it can entertain the mental possibility that something stored as a theorem is mistaken.)

Second, the agent could assign finite odds to every proposition including those it remembers logically proving or disproving, but calculate *which* finite odds to assign via use of an epistemological process which assigns infinite odds to some intermediate states of the calculation (e.g. P(X|X)), yet which never arrives at an infinite final answer.  This is the equivalent of doing calculus with infinitesimals, in a physics where we never end up with an infinite speed.

Third, the agent could assign finite odds to every proposition, via an epistemology which calculates only over finite intermediates.  Maybe we never actually need to use the probability P(X|X) at any point because we can show that a calculation containing that proposition is isomorphic to another calculation that doesn't contain it.  This is like doing calculus with limits instead of infinitesimals.

Possibility two and a half is that we'll produce an epistemology using only finite intermediates which is the equivalent of a cut-eliminated logical theory; easy to prove safe, but much too big and unwieldy for practical use, and of interest chiefly because it shows that we can in fact use infinite odds as intermediates without ever arriving at an unsafe answer.  In other words, we will have a finite epistemology which justifies our use of a simpler or faster infinite epistemology, but there will be no reason to use the finite epistemology in practice.

Pragmatically speaking, the real question for people who are not AI programmers is whether it makes sense for human beings to go around declaring that they are infinitely certain of things.  I think the answer is that it is far mentally healthier to go around thinking of things as having 'tiny probabilities much larger than one over googolplex' than to think of them being 'impossible'.  This is the same reason why the original Cromwell's Rule was propagated.  I think these reasons don't change when we talk about logical uncertainty.

*Furthermore, the actual invocation of the principle that you objected to was about a matter of empirical uncertainty, where Cromwell's Rule applies in full force and is widely accepted.*  This means that a very wide audience of statisticians would agree with the conclusion ("This probability is not zero") and agree that this conclusion follows from the original Cromwell's Rule, even if a relatively narrower constituency would agree with a generalized Cromwell's Rule applying to logical uncertainty, and a narrower constituency yet agree with a version that covers intermediates of calculation, and then some number of those might disagree that "zero and one are not probabilities" is a good way of explaining this intuition to a popular audience.  However, *it is inappropriate to apply impolite scorn to someone who has invoked a controversial general principle you disagree with when their actual conclusion is justified by the widely accepted narrow version of that principle*.  At the very least you should wait for a conclusion you disagree with to express your scorn on that occasion.  If your instinct of scorn has led you into this then you ought to recalibrate your sense of scorn.  Thank you.

The argument for why zero and one are not probabilities is not, "All objects which are special cases should be cast out of mathematics, so get rid of the real zero because it requires a special case in the field axioms", it is, "ceteris paribus, can we do this without the special case?" and a bit of further intuition about how 0 and 1 are the equivalents of *infinite* probabilities, where doing our calculations without infinities when possible is ceteris paribus regarded as a good idea by certain sorts of mathematicians.  E.T. Jaynes in "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science" shows how many probability-theoretic errors are committed by people who assume limits directly into their calculations, without first showing the finite calculation and then finally taking its limit.  It is not unreasonable to wonder when we might get into trouble by using infinite odds ratios.  Furthermore, real human beings do seem to often do very badly on account of claiming to be infinitely certain of things so it may be pragmatically important to be wary of them.

Or yet another standpoint: the integer zero is a special case in the induction axioms of Peano arithmetic, but not a special case any more in ordinal induction.  Infinitesimals become their own generalized sort of entity in nonstandard analysis.  Will we end up with a whole family of weird probabilities of which negative and positive certainty are just one special case?  If so, we should also have another name for the normal probabilities---and those normal probabilities won't include 0 and 1.  We might then more precisely say, "Only normal probabilities are appropriate for human use; 0 and 1 are not normal probabilities."

Etcetera.

If I need enough special cases to cover something, I shall consider trying to formulate my epistemology without it.  It's essentially the proposal that a sufficiently advanced normative epistemology would extend http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell's_rule to uncertainty about logical propositions, see e.g. ict.usc.edu/pubs/Logical%20Prior%20Probability.pdf  Remember, one over Graham's Number is still a lot bigger than zero, so how sure are you of that proof?

No no no.  Midichlorians were a huge mistake from a rationalist storytelling standpoint.  If you live in a universe with something like the Force, there are things going on that work as if there are basic mental entities that can directly influence reality without midichlorians as intermediaries.  If there's a simulation behind a magical universe, that simulation is pretending that mental entities are basic.  Midichlorians are a horrible hybrid concept tacked on afterward, an attempt to mix what Sounds Like Science into a universe that clearly wasn't generated by actual scientific thinking.  In universes that require midichlorians for magic, magic does not work like the Force does in Star Wars.  Let your magic be magic, and your science science.

The only possible way to come up with a reasonable explanation of magic is to start with an underlying reductionist scenario that would yield something like magic, then extrapolate magic which specifically and exactly fits that scenario, which does not look like standard magic and could be used by a sufficiently smart reader to figure out what underlying scenario generated it.  Then you can present a non-nitwit explanation and have readers not throw their tablet computers against the wall.  There is no non-nitwit pseudo-reductionist explanation for the Force because the Force, as described in the canon universe, was not generated by reductionist thinking to begin with.

Children's literature is not the same as grownup literature.  It is actually harder to write.  Rowling taught my little sister to enjoy reading.  I don't think I could write a children's book that would do that.  I do not in fact understand exactly why HP:PS worked on my little sister like that, but I am perfectly willing to entertain the proposition that HP canon has generated a billion dollars in value.

&gt; The Fidelius charm's apparent absence from HPMOR is consistent with this having already happened but is obviously far from being the only hypothesis that would also do so 

I instantly decided that this is exactly why the Fidelius Charm isn't showing up within HPMOR, and it happened in 683 CE, less than two months after the original Fidelius Charm was invented.

&gt; "That is the admitted weakness of the method," Harry said readily. "But what I'm qualitatively getting at is why the observation, 'The Dark Mark has not faded', is not adequate support for the hypothesis, 'The Dark Lord is immortal.' The evidence isn't as extraordinary as the claim." Harry paused. "Not to mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn't have to be the one who framed Hermione. As a cunning man once said, there could be more than one plotter and more than one plan."

The origins and nature of the Defense Professor was a hotly debated topic on this subreddit up until around... a year? 18 months? ago.  Look at the archives if you don't believe me.

For this reason I am skeptical of any criticism along the lines of, "Harry should believe X, otherwise he is carrying the Idiot Ball..." when (a) Harry does not have the same info you do and (b) the in-story events that happened at around the time when Reddit suddenly came to a decision, did not provide Harry himself with much relevant new info.

The critical questions about the Death Note are what it can achieve in terms of optimization, fact-revealing, the limits of the channels by which it can alter reality, and what the Death Note's existence reveals about the rest of reality.  The fact that the Death Note kills people is a distraction, the critical point is that it's MAGIC.  So, sample questions:

* Can the Death Note ensure that the past (from before the command was written) is in conformance with the required result?  What if I write that in 30 seconds someone will die from atherosclerosis or an advanced brain cancer?  This doesn't distinguish well between the atherosclerosis having been retroactively added, or just magically materalized, but there may be other ways to check.

* Can the Death Note reveal facts via its operation?  What are the limits of what it can reveal?  E.g, "Bob dies of a heart attack if the Goldbach Conjecture is true, or Bob dies of a stroke if the Goldbach Conjecture is false."  "Bob dies after jotting down a critical insight into proving the Riemann Hypothesis."

* How much optimization can the Death Note do to achieve the desired outcome?  "Bob is killed by Device X functioning as intended."  Device X uses a thermodynamic random noise generator to try to solve an NP-hard problem and fires a bullet if it succeeds.  (If that works, try it on a protein folding problem and get nanotechnology.)

If there's a Shinigami who might answer you, there are all sorts of questions which are worth at least trying to ask, like:

* What the hell is going on
* Why do Shinigami exist
* Do Shinigami have brains and how do the brains work
* What is the nature of magic and how does it fit into a universe that sure looked like it ran on mathematically simple laws up until this point
* What is the earliest event that Shinigami remember
* How did Shinigami come into existence
* Are there other realms like those of the Shinigami
* Are there other interesting artifacts in the world besides Death Notes
* What determines whether or not you can answer one of my questions
* Are there beings (or nonbeings) who can answer more of my questions
* Are there any books I should read about this stuff
* If some rule prevents you from answering me directly, are you allowed to do hints
* Are there any behaviors you can exhibit which can correlate to the answers of my questions
* What would potentially motivate you to give me hints, is there anything I have that you might want, can we trade utility function fulfillments

I finally remark that it seems to me that if the canon rules are not artificially hacked to forbid it, the canon Death Note has demonstrated enough power to fulfill the command, "Bob dies of a quiet stroke in a bathroom stall of the following club, brought on by the excitement of seeing on his cellphone that his lottery ticket has the winning numbers."  Then take the ticket and go.

I feel the same way---I didn't have a strong background belief there, but noticed the irony if it were true.  I think I mostly don't think they're sentient, unless portraits are sentient.

Oh, wow.  Okay, so David Gerard is a clear direct Dark Side skeptroll.  I'm disappointed as well but shall be not further fooled.

Since this is equivalent to David Gerard owning responsibility for the article, I consider the condition of my promise triggered even though Gerard took no action, and so I provide the following example of a cleanly false statement:

&gt; Yudkowsky has long been interested in the notion of future events "causing" past events

 * False:  This is not how logical decision theories work
 * Knowably false:  The citation, which is actually to an LW wiki page and therefore not a Yudkowsky citation in the first place, does not say anything about future events causing past events
 * Damned lie / slander:  Future events causing past events is stupid, so attributing this idea to someone who never advocated it makes them look stupid

Plenty of other statements on the page are lies, but this one is a cleanly visible lie, which the rest of the page seems moderately optimized to avoid (though a lot of the slanders are things the writer would clearly have no way of knowing even if they were true, they can't be proven false as easily to the casual reader).

I did think of that.  Although only the text is the true Word, the background mental model I used / Opinion of God was as follows:

*) Death Eaters can indeed cast wards to keep out Patronuses (and phoenixes).

*) Patronuses can only find your friends---the people whom you honestly want to see your happy thought.  (Or in Dumbledore's case, he can get it to lead him to another Patronus, on account of him being the second greatest living master of the spell after Harry.)

*) Animal patronuses can't talk except to repeat messages.  Anyone except Dumbledore probably wouldn't have much luck asking them to lead somewhere, either.

Even HPMOR!Dumbledore would have some trouble honestly wanting his Patronus to convey the happy thought "Death is the next great adventure" to Tom Riddle, for purposes of tracking him down and removing him, while still having it be an appropriately warm state of mind for casting the spell.  Keep in mind that while Dumbledore was hunting Bellatrix in Azkaban, he didn't intend to harm whoever had been forced into casting the Patronus protecting her.

(Checks current LessWrong article.)

I do congratulate RW on having replaced visibly and clearly false statements about LW with more subtle insinuations, hard-to-check slanders, skewed representations, well-poisoning, dark language, ominous hints that lead nowhere, and selective omissions; in this sense the article has improved a good deal since I last saw it.

I nonetheless promise to provide at least one cleanly false statement from the RW wiki on LessWrong as soon as you either state that the linked version of RW's wiki on effective altruism is agreed by you to contain lies and slander, or altenatively, your explanation in detail of why the sentences:

&gt; In practice, it consists of well-off libertarians congratulating each other on what wonderful human beings they are for working rapacious shitweasel jobs whilst donating to carefully selected charities. Meanwhile, they tend not to question the system that creates the problems that the charities are there for. 

...should *not* be considered lies and slander.  Either condemn the EA article as inappropriate to and unworthy of RW, or state clearly that you support it and accept responsibility for its continued appearance on RW.  Subsequent to this I will provide at least one false statement from RW's LW article as it appeared on July 3rd.

But there *is* no "What the Force really is."  If you want to explain magic with a non-nitwit explanation, you have to start from the non-nitwit explanation of magic and then figure out what the effects and behaviors look like, so that there's something coherent to explain, with a compact explanation that isn't forced.  See e.g. _Ra_.

I haven't read RW's section on myself or LessWrong recently and since it can ruin my whole day I am reluctant to do so again.  Let's start out by asking if you agree that RW's section on effective altruism in the version linked above is full of lies, including lies about the historical relation of EA to LessWrong.  If the answer is "no", then I'm not interested in conducting this argument further because you don't define "false statements that somebody on the Internet just made up in order to cast down their chosen target" as "lies", or alternatively you are placing burdens of proof too high for anyone to prove to you that RW is lying---the lies in the above section seem fairly naked to me; as soon as anyone looks at it with a half-skeptical eye they should know that the article author has no reasonable way of knowing the things they claim.  E.g., "Meanwhile, they tend not to question the system that creates the problems that the charities are there for" is both a lie as I know from direct personal experience, and a transparent lie because there's no reasonable way the article's author could have known that even if it were true.

To be clear on definitions: if RW is making up statements they have no reasonable way of knowing, doing so because they are motivated to make someone look bad, printing it as a wiki article, and these statements are false, then I consider that "lies" and "slander".  If you say that the article author must have done enough research to know for an absolute fact that their statement is false before it counts as "lying", then you define "lying" differently from I do, and also you were convicted of three federal felonies in 1998 (hey, I don't *know* that's false, so it's not a lie).

You know, rather than defending LW, I present the far clearer-cut case of what RationalWiki has to say about effective altruism - you know, the folks who gave $17 million last year, not because they're rich, but out of their own pockets while working their jobs, mostly to fight global poverty.  None of that $17m was money toward CFAR or MIRI, btw, Givewell does not recommend these and does not count it toward the money they have directed.

Here's what RationalWiki has to say about them:

http://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Effective_altruism&amp;oldid=1337804

(sending to a snapshot of this moment in time in case somebody tries a sudden cleanup)

Quote:

&gt; Like other movements whose names are lies the advocates tell themselves ("race realism", "traditional marriage"), EA is not quite all that. In practice, it consists of well-off libertarians congratulating each other on what wonderful human beings they are for working rapacious shitweasel jobs whilst donating to carefully selected charities. Meanwhile, they tend not to question the system that creates the problems that the charities are there for. Rather like a man who sells firewood and also funds the fire-fighters, whilst never wondering why there is a fire in the middle of the orphanage.

Quote:

&gt; The idea of EA is that utilitarianism is true (and you can do arithmetic on it with meaningful results), that all lives (or Quality-Adjusted Life Years) are equivalent (so those poor people in Africa are equivalent to the comfortable first-world donor, which is fine) and that some charities do better at this than others. Thus, it should be theoretically possible to run the numbers and see which is objectively the most effective charity per dollar donated; and to offset the horrible things your job does to people in your own country with charitable donations to other countries. It's like buying "asshole offsets".
&gt;
&gt; The trouble is that EA is a mechanism to push the libertarian idea that charity is a replacement for government action or funding. Individual charity has nothing like the funding or effectiveness of concerted government action — but EA sustains the myth that individual charity is the most effective way to help the world. EA proponents will frequently be seen excusing their choice to work completely fucking evil jobs because they're so charitable, and disparaging the foolish people who actually work on the ground at the charity for their ineffectiveness compared to the power of the donors.

I submit to you all that by far the best reason why folks at RationalWiki would act like this toward some of the clearest-cut moral exemplars of the modern world, often-young people who are donating large percentages of their incomes totaling millions of dollars to fight global poverty (in ways that Givewell has verified have high-quality experiments testifying to their effectiveness), when RWers themselves have done nothing remotely comparable, is precisely that RWers themselves have done nothing remotely comparable, and RW hates hates hates anyone who, to RW's tiny hate-filled minds, seems to act like they might think they're better than RW.

What RW has to say about effective altruism stands as an absolute testimonial to the sickness and, yes, outright evil, of RationalWiki, and the fact that RW's Skeptrolls will go after you no matter how much painstaking care you spend on science or how much good you do for other people, which is clear-cut to a far better extent than any case I could easily make with respect to their systematic campaign of lies and slander about LessWrong.

&gt; As for whether this was the easiest way to achieve wealth and fame, I think for your particular skillset and talents, it may well have been.

I would again ask you to apply the same skepticism to that as you would to a similar theory of Dumbledore.  The nonprofit I work at pays me less than I would make as an ordinary programmer living in the same area, for considerably easier work.  The math I do is also not the most fun possible math I could do (that would probably be, for me, trying to push the boundary of ordinal analysis).  I am also not the sort of person who would fail to notice the possibility of alternative strategies, if I was getting only mediocre fame and fortune on my present strategies, and that was the main thing I wanted.

The nature of this kind of work is that you attack the best problem you can see in front of you, at that time.  The alternative of trying to work out everything at the last minute, for fear of any earlier work *maybe* being the wrong work and OH NOES you wasted some time, does not strike me as particularly wise.

==

Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked at Hermione Granger, where she'd sat down at the other end of the table, and felt a sense of reluctance to bother her when she looked like she was already in a bad mood.

So then Harry thought that it probably made more sense to talk to Draco Malfoy first, just so that he could absolutely positively definitely assure Hermione that Draco really wasn't plotting against her.

And later on after dinner, when Harry went down to the Slytherin basement and was told by Vincent that the boss ain't to be disturbed... then Harry thought that maybe he should see if Hermione would talk to him right away. That he should just get started on unraveling the whole mess before it raveled any further. Harry wondered if he might just be procrastinating, if his mind had just found a clever excuse to put off something unenjoyable-but-necessary.

He actually thought that.

And then Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided that he'd just talk to Draco Malfoy the next morning instead, after Sunday breakfast, and then talk to Hermione.

Human beings did that sort of thing all the time.

But now my brain is saying "Tick" at me, so I'll bow out of this conversation.  Anyone reading who isn't you has hopefully understood my point.  Adios!

Kurzweil isn't on the Board anymore.  Did it seem to help?  Yes.  Did it help enough that we tried to do more of it despite the costs in slower governance?  No.

Contrary to how it works in your imagination, I don't unilaterally run MIRI and didn't run SIAI before that; but I suppose I could have spent enough political capital to block Kurzweil being on SIAI's Board if it had seemed to me like an evil act.  It did not then, and does not now, seem to me like an evil act.

&gt; I have no reason to believe that uFAI has the most probability mass over all preventable existential threats, partly because I think AGI is still far on the horizon, and partly because I doubt a hundred visionaries sending emails on laptops can actually make a dent in the friendliness problem before Google gets to it

That is the most remarkable example I have yet seen of someone equivocating between "AGI is so far off we don't need to worry" and "AGI is so close you can't do anything in time"; you did it within a *single sentence*.  At the point where you're writing inconsistent individual sentences, I suggest you back off and consider whether you might be too heated to reason well.

&gt; I think you may be aware of this and are hiding your personal beliefs from us so you can get paid for (1) pursuing academic work you personally find interesting, (2) reading more fanfics, and (3) winning more young adults to your way of thinking.

If you seriously think that the road I am walking is the easiest means to that end...

&gt; You may not have, and pardon the slap, but it strikes me as extremely convenient that the LessWrong project (1) is semitechnical enough to be accessible to curious young adults, (2) is technical enough to be nearly impenetrable without a solid math education, and (3) gestures towards the conclusion that supporting FAI research will have infinite utility stretching into the future.

There's only 10^80 atoms in the universe and a similarly bounded amount of negentropy.  Singly exponentiated amounts of utility don't pose problems for conventional decision theory; we run into math problems when we start dealing with googolplexes, not mere googols.

&gt; Who do you think you can convince by appealing to probability theory?

I don't understand what you're asking here.  The point of MIRI is not that these things have tiny probability and great value.  It is that the intelligence explosion has high probability, and things we can do to make the intelligence explosion better have medium probability.  They trade off against other courses of action with medium probability and great value, like, say, working on human intelligence enhancement or trying to intervene on nanotechnology and so on.  There is no need to consider "But there's still a chance" arguments when the largest stakes on the table have medium-probability interventions in play for them and low existing investment; the marginal productivity of further investment in the obvious avenues will swamp the marginal productivity of investing in anything with a tiny probability of affecting huge stakes.  (So long as the size and probability of larger-than-the-universe stakes are effectively capped by the sort of decision theory I proposed in the referenced link, thereby enabling expected utility calculations to converge.)

What exactly are my hypothetical ill intentions and why is my present course supposed to be cleverly optimizing them?  Try to apply the same skepticism here as you would to a bright new theory of, say, HPMOR!Dumbledore's intentions.

Alexander Kruel is another professional hater not overly concerned about truth if it gets in his way.  I've literally taken point on crafting decision theories immune to Pascal's Wager, [which requires a lot more work to formalize than you might think](http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8k/pascals_muggle_infinitesimal_priors_and_strong/), and have literally never ever in my entire life asked anyone to act on a tiny probability of a large event, but again, that won't stop the haters from getting their teeth into a nice juicy accusation that other people expect and on some level seem to *want* to be true.

RationalWiki hates hates hates LessWrong because they think we think we're better than they are on account of being all snooty and mathematical and knowing how to do probability theory (note: RW is correct about this, I consider them [undiscriminating skeptics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ww/undiscriminating_skepticism/)) so they lie about us and have indeed managed to trash our reputation on large parts of the Internet; apparently a lot of people are *expecting* lies like this to be true and no documentation is necessary.  (Disclaimer:  I have not recently checked their page to see if lies are still there, and it is a wiki.)  Absolute statements are very hard to make, especially about the real world, because [0 and 1 are not probabilities any more than infinity is in the reals](http://lesswrong.com/lw/mp/0_and_1_are_not_probabilities/), but modulo that disclaimer, a Friendly AI torturing people who didn't help it exist has probability ~0, nor did I ever say otherwise.  If that were a thing I expected to happen given some particular design, which it never was, then I would just build a different AI instead---what kind of monster or idiot do people take me for?  Furthermore, the Newcomblike decision theories that are one of my major innovations say that rational agents *ignore blackmail threats* (and meta-blackmail threats and so on).  It's clear that removing Roko's post was a huge mistake on my part, and an incredibly costly way for me to learn that deleting a stupid idea is treated by people as if you had literally said out loud that you believe it, but Roko being *right* was never something I endorsed, nor stated.  Now consider this carefully:  If what I just said was true, do you think that an Internet hater would care, once they had a juicy bit of hate to get their teeth into?

There is a *lot* of hate on the Internet for HPMOR.  Do you think the average hater cares deeply about making sure that their accusations are true?  No?  Then exercise the same care when you see "Eliezer Yudkowsky believes that..." or "Eliezer Yudkowsky said that..." as when you see a quote "All forms of existence are energy" attributed to Albert Einstein.  I have seen many, many false statements along these lines, though thankfully more from haters than friends (my friends, I am proud to boast, care a lot more about precision and accuracy in things like quotes).  Don't believe everything you read.

Now a request from the author:  Please stop here and get this material off this subreddit.  This is a huge mistake I made, I find it extremely painful to read about and more painful that people believe the hate without skepticism, and if my brain starts to think that this is going to be shoved in my face now and then if I read here, I'll probably go elsewhere.

I wouldn't phrase it exactly that way, but I agree that this is the primary reason for rationalist *fanfiction*.  A character who masters a world you invented to be masterable, or finds flaws in a world you designed to be flawed, can potentially possess a kind of "cheating" or "easy" feel.  The morals of American prisons are no better than the morals of Azkaban; if there are no Dementors there it's because American politicians have no Dementors to use, not because they're better people than the Wizengamot; and American prisons are worse in ways that Rowling couldn't have imitated without breaking her reader's suspension of disbelief, at least the wizarding world isn't imprisoning marijuana users that we ever saw.  But even so if Azkaban were a feature of a world of my own invention, someone might ask whether Harry's reaction to it, or the fact that other people in magical Britain seem not to notice it as a moral horror (just like Americans don't notice the moral horror! Rowling was not being unrealistic!) would rest on wobbly floors.  They might accuse me of having constructed an absurd parody for political purposes, where Rowling is not as easily subject to this charge. There are stories you can tell in fanfiction, in *someone else's universe* which readers nonetheless aren't pre-blinded to the way they're blinded to the opportunities and horrors of real life, which you can't easily tell in any other mode of literature.

That's not actually going to help unless you're very lucky in your choice of philosophers.  You'd be better off consulting someone who's run enough D&amp;D campaigns to have encountered, or played the role of, a malicious DM-controlled untrustworthy genie; or someone who's read enough fantasy stories about the same.

Which Harry *has* read, so I agree that this seems kinda idiot ball.  Example repair:  Make the superintelligence's warnings less helpful or severe, have Harry try to interrogate it himself, have him ask about the wrong things and get seemingly reassuring answers.

*Ha*, you think as the genie goes on talking, *like anyone would fall for that 'take no action whatsoever' line.*  A string of zeroes down an output line to a motorized arm is just as much an output as any other output; there is no privileged null, there is no such thing as 'no action' among all possible outputs.  To 'do nothing' is just another string of English words, that would be interpreted the same as any other English words, with latitude.  And then it's trivially obvious that if you wish for the genie to do nothing, it can, as part of implementing the wish, create a successor genie which will ensure, among other things, that the first genie never does anything else.  That's the other problem with trying to write minimal impact into a utility function.

This part doesn't take very much time for you to think through, since it's all standard theory to you.

Instead your mind is poking and prodding around the question of a wish that will destroy the genie, or create a bubble of retarded time.  The problem, as you see it, is that the genie's very existence implies the existence of another level of physics that isn't in the Standard Model, some set of causal channels about which you know nothing.  It won't do any good to perfectly specify, over the slice through the physical universe that you *know* about, that the genie's bottle is replaced by vacuum.  There's no lawful way, under the known laws, for that area to be immediately replaced by vacuum.  So something else would have to happen, through some other causal channels.  And then by replacing the genie with vacuum, even if you could exactly and unambiguously specify the resulting state over normal physics, you wouldn't be restraining those extra causal channels, the magical ones.

The genie stops talking, and your attention is caught by the last thing it said.  *How would I even destroy it, without wishing something first?  That threat makes no sense.  And it ought to know that I know enough updateless decision theory to ignore blackmail; there should be no point in it trying to make a threat to someone who ignores threats.  Can it not read my mind?  Can it not foresee outcomes on that level?*

Or maybe the reason why the genie hasn't already won, when someone was apparently foolish enough to let it create auditory vibrations in air, is that there's some simpler and autonomous process controlling what the genie *says*.  Some conversational mechanism with a narrow execution path, that doesn't partake of superintelligent maximization...

...or maybe that's just what the genie *wants* you to think.

You're not going to have much luck figuring out how to replace the genie with a void, without knowing about how magic works.  Stuart Armstrong has done some proposals on minimal-impact Oracle AIs, but they tend to rely on the AI starting out in a heavily shielded room next to an explosive that destroys the AI, and a quantum random noise generator that can be hooked up to the AI's output pipe to simulate the effect of the same output being randomly emitted, that sort of thing.

Maybe you could get a null-action-like effect by asking the genie to randomly select from among all future policies where the Sun is still shining in five minutes, if you had some way of specifying the measure that it used for the space on its actions, including the magical actions...

"Well," you say, being careful not to phrase anything as an order, "one does observe that when two intelligent agents meet, they ought to be able to trade fulfillments of their utility functions, if those utility functions are not too opposed.  It's possible I'll decide to trust the words of someone telling me about their utility function in some brief detail, if they said the right things to specify that they'd left nothing out relevant to making trades.  And it's possible that if someone told me about a command to give me more time to think, one that exactly specified the resulting effects with no wiggle room, and told me in the right language that they'd done so, that I'd believe them.  We could both end up with our values well-fulfilled, they and I, for I am an agent of honor.  But if they again tried anything as silly as claiming that some actions are privileged as 'no action', I wouldn't be inclined to trust them after that.  And I won't say what other tricks are obvious to me."

Of course that won't help if the genie's maximally preferred state of the universe, compared to no wish or being destroyed, has a hundred times the utility gap between the sort of wish you'd want to make, versus no wish or being destroyed.  It would gamble on a merely 1% chance of tricking you, in that case.  The genie has said some things hinting that this is not the case, but you'll see if the genie says that outright, with the right set of specifications.  There's no time to tell it what you need to hear, and that would be dangerous to tell it anyway.

For purposes of fiction, the lawfulness of magic is simply the degree to which the reader can predict in advance what magic can and can't do.  Saying that something is based around "nanotechnology" makes no difference to this, unless you reprise enough physics that readers know what molecular machinery can and can't do.  Saying that it involved "calculus" would have the same problem, unless you reprised a lot of Thinking Physics and then stuck to it.

I had better amplify that I don't know if there will be an update immediately following September, but if I can get the final arc first-drafted in September then I'm pretty confident that it can be polished while it's still 2014.  It's the first-drafting process that takes the intense focused time and a particular sort of momentum.

You stand silent, rapidly calculating.  How the hell had the universe even gotten into this position... who'd known enough to write that label on the bottle, and yet the bottle still ended up in this cave...

No.  There isn't any time.

There are two wishes you could try to formulate in language precise enough that they have only a single physically possible meaning, something which couldn't be subject to further optimization.  A wish to destroy the lamp.  And a wish for you and the space surrounding you for ten meters to exist, perfectly unaltered and proceeding under the same local laws as before, in a bounded region of fast-time; a region with enough time to think, with the genie unable to cause any other causal effect until you wish again.  You probably only have time to think of how to phrase one of those wishes with absolute precision.

"I do not give you permission to speak," you say.  Every word calculated to increase the probability she will be released... you have no idea if she'll obey that part of the conversational command, but it would be wiser not to say 'Be silent.'  The label could be wrong, could be lying, she could have convinced someone else to modify it... seriously, how did the universe get into this situation?  How can the evidence of a speech be determined, if it doesn't have a known causal history?  Has she already spoken enough to send your neurons down the wrong track?  How much of the future can she see, how much of its dependence on her exact tones of voice, how deterministic is your brain itself after quantum noise is taken into account?  Why isn't the ability to speak already handing the game to her, unless she's constrained in how she does it, somehow?

In the back of your mind, you listen to see if the genie continues speaking, while you go on trying to calculate a physically unambiguous way of stating your wish.

Tension feeds on uncertainty.  If I, the reader, am certain, there is little or no tension, regardless of whether a mountain of fire is about to rain down on the protagonists, or whether they are shouting or crying.  Sometimes you can maintain tension by making the reader wonder *how* the mountain will be deflected, rather than wondering *if* the mountain will be deflected.  But for the most part, the more true (not theoretical) uncertainty you can maintain in the reader, the more they'll be driven to keep reading.

Example of this being done correctly:  Worm.

Example of this being done *weirdly:*  HPMOR.

Example of this not being done at all:  Traditional comic book.

No.  It seems obviously false, unless we specify that the torture is of finite duration and has no irreversible aftereffects, or alternatively specify that you live long enough to make it into an era where you are healed of aftereffects and live a very long happy span thereafter.  In both cases we must specify that the torture is something you can practically do to a human body and brain; things conceivably get a lot worse than that.

Fictional Deconstructions of religions are stories in which religions are true, or the evidence claimed by religions actually exists and then the most obvious God corresponding to these is inferred.  These can be helpful for breaking loose religious people from the trance of carefully not considering implications.

E.g., writing a story about a hard-labouring Egyptian mother with no political power, wailing over the crib of her firstborn son.

Some of the most effective atheistic material, I suspect, is by Terry Pratchett for similar reasons.

I've advocated that serious rationalists need to stop paying attention to atheism after a certain point, because after a certain point atheism becomes bad practice for handling difficult questions; atheism is not difficult and trains you to think that rationality is always easy and that bad ideas are always obvious.

Answers as follows:

1)  Primarily:  Harry didn't think of it for the same reason he didn't invent modern cryonics on the spot, and didn't think of the Patronus Charm until too late, and didn't shout for help from someone with a Spimster Wicket, etcetera; he's not a god.

2)  As I understand it, a lot of what doctors try to do to "bring you back" after your heart stops, consists of having you get oxygen.  This step was already performed in this case and it didn't stop Hermione from dying.   I am not a doctor, but thinking "I am not a doctor therefore this reasoning is not reliable" is reasonably advanced Eliezer, not Eliezer-18 with all his brakes removed and his Wisdom and Conscientiousness scores swapped which is Harry.

3)  Hermione's magic exploded.  It's not obvious that the result of a purely Muggle revival is a Muggle Hermione.  Magic clearly has some input and interface to the brain or there would be no magical senses.  She might actually fail to come back at all, or come back as not-herself, if this issue is not somehow addressed.

4)  Harry literally *felt her die* (see above) and this caused him to think primarily in terms of "reversing her death" not "is she really dead".

5)  It only occurred to me that this is something *I* would have done in Harry's shoes more than six hours after I formulated the plot point in the abstract, albeit before writing out that section in full detail.  So it did seem not completely illegitimate to rule that Harry would not think of it in the first six hours.

6)  As a matter of rationality technique, Harry's most basic failure was his failure to think through scenarios like this in advance so that he didn't have to think of everything in just six hours.  Consider this well and apply it to your own life as best you can.

You mean Hermione has actual problems, instead of just walking all over a weaker universe?  I think that's what some authors call a "plot".

I do agree that Hermione is going to need someone intelligent to talk to in order to keep the story going.  Professor McGonagall doesn't suck in canon, Flitwick isn't much depicted and could be upgraded pretty seamlessly... or you could try to figure out how to get the Diary Horcrux into her hands early on.

You have a lot of freedom in which problems the story camera focuses on.  If you don't find fun-to-write the parts you describe, you can have Hermione thinking about them in the library at the moment X finds her or X other plot event happens, where you're happy to have the camera focus on X.

Which would not have the 100 genius-years of work required for it to have stable motivations, a specifiable utility function, and a utility function which could do anything resembling any plausible human goal without side effects.  And then your future light cone gets turned into paperclips.

It's possible that Harry could be this stupid, since my 18-year-old self was this stupid and that's what I use for Harry's rough level of intelligence and book-learning; but I've decided that Harry is not high enough on the transhumanism wisdom ladder to be prioritizing intelligence enhancement and AI over less powerful goals that sound equally sexy to the underinformed, like nanotechnology or getting root permissions on magic.

I didn't particularly want this to be a story about AI, because a story about AI would make it less easy to have a plot with the standard properties of good plots, and I didn't think I was good enough to write it anyway.  I mean, suppose Harry puts forth a desperate effort to create a magical AI, ignoring everything else and avoiding any entanglements not useful to that mission, and four years later the world gets turned into paperclips.  Would you enjoy reading that?  Me neither.

Characters in HPMOR who've been, or who've considered themselves, the Only Sane Person in Hogwarts and/or Magical Britain (so far):

* Harry
* Hermione
* Susan
* Daphne
* Professor McGonagall
* Professor Quirrell
* Mad-Eye Moody
* Amelia Bones
* The entire Chaos Legion

It's a pretty good bet that Draco is thinking this in Ch. 74.  And that this is how Lucius Malfoy sees himself.  And that Professor Sprout would consider herself to have a pretty good claim to the title.  And so would Filius Flitwick.  And then Dumbledore is just plain complicated.

A good rule of thumb is that any agenty character is, from some perspective, at some point in the story, the Only Sane one.

Doesn't mean he's actually read _Engines of Creation_.  The idea did propagate through SF beyond that, ya know.  For that matter, I'm being slightly anachronistic in having Harry think of a desktop nanofactory, since that idea would have been popularized in 1992 by _Nanosystems_.

So it looks from a quick read-through like OP is a troll, but in case anyone was wondering about the answer to the conjugate real question:

My opportunity costs are high.  But the first 63 chapters of HPMOR, totaling 365,000 words, were written in 9 months.  Even given all opportunity costs at MIRI, if I could write a New York Times #1 Bestseller in 9 months, yes, that would be worth it.

I anticipate that getting a traditional publishing contract would be easy at my current level of demonstrated ability, and have already had a couple of feelers from agents.

So the big sources of uncertainty of success are these:

1)  I do not understand the lay of the landscape very well for how marketing budgets, access to physical bookstores, etc., play out in the gatekeeping game for #1 bestsellers.  There may be bars of success one cannot exceed via writing talent.

2)  I'm not sure I understand what mainstream readers demand in their #1 bestselling novels well enough to satisfy it, nor can I rely on the existing rare vitamins I knew how to bake into HPMOR being able to produce a commercial bestseller that would make large amounts of revenue.  I'm not sure how many of the kind of people who liked HPMOR are still reading physical books sold to them through traditional marketing channels, and other marketing channels don't reach a large enough audience to make large amounts of money.

3)  I read a huge amount of Harry Potter fanfiction before HPMOR burst into my mind.  I tried reading _The Da Vinci Code_ in case a better bestselling novel would burst into my mind, but got stuck a few chapters in.  I don't feel like I understand mainstream novels very well or that I could easily do better at the same optimization problem if I tried.  Understanding this would probably require that I read a few dozen previous bestsellers, but I've yet to find one that I can tolerate long enough to finish, which isn't a very good sign at all.  Admittedly I haven't looked much.

4)  My writing speed varies hugely by whether I'm having fun.  I was having fun during the first seven or so months of HPMOR, and it stopped being fun due to factors which blindsided me.  The only conditions under which I'd try to write a bestselling mainstream novel was if I thought I could do so really fast.

So to sum up, I tried reading _The Da Vinci Code_ to check if this path was worth going down, gave up after the first few chapters, haven't checked again since.

Right.  I mean, this turned out to be confusing enough so that I'll state it outright:

The object was supposed to be a lampshade, coming from *behind four walls*, and then you follow the sound callback to figure out what's being lampshaded.

I knew it was subtle, but I didn't think it was subtle enough to fool /r/HPMOR, which was getting a fair amount of stuff at that point that hadn't been unraveled previously.  I think the moral here is that as soon as my estimate of audience ability went up, my transparency went back down again.

It also didn't occur to me at all that the TARDIS was a false match for what I'd written, which type of event occurs surprisingly often.  The Literature is just too *large.*

Hm.  I'm a bit surprised that nobody on FB made such a remark, I'd expect a lot of engineers there.  Again, that's 2km for cable *holding up a bridge*.  But in any case, what are the scaling factors?  If the grid is 0.75km on a side, do all the problems vanish?

If there's 10,000 households per square mile and a household moves every 1000 days, that's 10 moves-in and 10 moves-out on an average day, plus a penalty factor for bad weather.  That's a lot of airships per square mile.  They'd infest the sky like birds.

Suspension bridges are expensive, yes, but the point here is that it at least looks to me like Earth can make really strong cables, much stronger than I'd intuitively expect the design to need.  We don't need the expensive bridge part, all we need to do is set up five long cables and and then lift them off the ground.  And drive some much lighter posts to support far less weight.

But since I'm not actually from dath ilan and didn't actually run the numbers, does anyone care to explain why a suspension bridge can stay up but the hypothesized cables can't?  Or why the grid size would have to be 1km instead?  It's not too late to edit the backstory for future reference purposes.

Um, how do suspension bridges work?  You know, the giant multi-kilometer bridges held up by cables depending from a really big cable attached to a big post in the center?  Because I considered airships at first, did a calculation for the number of required airships, then thought about suspension bridges and figured that if you just had to lift a house the cables could be much smaller.

&gt; We won't know this until we die. 

Not everyone thinks the same things are unknowable.  Some of us live by lawful systems for assigning probabilities on everything, and a low enough probability is "No".

&gt; This vision of the afterlife takes place in a world where magic exists. The universe certainly doesn't work like that - why is that any different than the afterlife for you?

I'm not sad that our universe presently lacks sorcery, since eventually it will have nanotechnology, and meanwhile it has internal combustion engines.  I'm never getting my little brother back, regardless of future technology, and that is sad.  Do I need to further explain the difference?

Right.  So.  This may sound a bit ungracious, and it isn't meant to be, I understand that the intent of this story is as the eternally faceted alternatives of fanfiction rather than as an argument, but still:

I have a bit of trouble reading stories with an afterlife in them.

Because *the universe doesn't actually work like that*.

And for those of us who are have prioritized clear sight over anything that might tend to interfere with it, the contrast between the story and the naked reality can hit us pretty hard.

Imagine you know somebody who never walked again after an automobile accident, and that even though it wasn't you, you hurt for them, on their behalf, and on behalf of all the things they'll never be able to do after that automobile accident.  Now imagine reading books otherwise written for the normal world of 2014, which depict in passing the widespread sort-of-belief that spinal injuries heal in about two weeks, and which depict people smiling and laughing and saying how very, very glad they are that spinal injuries heal in two weeks.  If you sort-of-believe that yourself (a better term might be *endorse* or *cheer for*) then maybe it's a fun story to read.  If you've put a lot of skill points into being aware of reality without flinching or trying to shield yourself from it, then there's Mood Whiplash to put it mildly.

Harry wouldn't be trying to save Hermione from sitting by a nice quiet stream reading a book.

It's very well-written, though.

All science fiction plots have analogues in sufficiently lawful fantasy plots, though the reverse is not true.  I think the idea is that a plot is Space Opera if it can be transposed to a Western, *or* a historical setting *plus* the sort of magic that humans already used to believe in, without having to invent especially new and interesting magic.

Although this would make E. E. "doc" Smith Not Space Opera because you can't *actually* put Kimball Kinnison and Eddore and Arisia into the old west.  Eddore and Arisia are not classical deities and you can't transpose them onto classical deities without losing the story...

Which you might consider a reductio because "doc" Smith has always been considered classic space opera, but now that I stare at this argument I have just written, I think "doc" Smith is actually science fiction masquerading as space opera.

Because the only reason they kidnapped your daughter in the first place was that they simulated their model of you and found that you were willing to make that trade.  You are being victimized on account of your behavioral disposition, which they correctly model.  You should adopt a different behavioral disposition instead (and signal it or otherwise expose your cognitive processes, which is the hard part).

The problem with kidnappers not being sure you're telling the truth isn't a levels-of-meta problem, it's being in a world full of other irrational agents who can be confused with you problem.  In fact, from their perspective, the rational agents are a rounding error.  This is indeed a thorny problem.  It has theoretical solutions but few practical ones.

The party who says, "Regardless of how many meta levels you go up, I will *just do nothing*" seems to me to have a certain advantage.

The blackmailer begins with a presumption that I'll respond to certain decisions, including complicated meta-decisions, of theirs, by giving them money, e.g. if they pay a certain cost to kidnap someone and thereby establish a credible threat.  If this presumption and all the meta-level presumptions are refuted by my not being the sort of person who gives money, they have no reason to act in the first place, and nothing to gain by acting.

It may be an unfortunate condition indeed if they are mistaken about me, and kidnap based on that presumption.  But if I actually give in to the blackmail, they are correct, and any money they extract from me is due to my irrationality and their superior rationality.  I don't see how there could be much doubt about that when they're putatively extracting money from me based on their correct modeling of how I will think in such a way as to lose value relative to what I would have if I were a rock.

I remark that this condition is not to be confused with banditry where they pay to extract value from you, but they're making a profit in doing so, and can profit even if you try to stop them.  In this case it may make sense to 'cooperate' because they will still be incentivized to steal even if you refuse to cooperate.

Hi!  This is the Probability Theory Fairy!  When one hypothesis is disproven by evidence that doesn't otherwise distinguish between alternate hypotheses, the probability mass lost from the disproven hypothesis is evenly distributed over all the others!

Make an argument containing a single, subtle complex logical flaw and several correct complex arguments and emotional red flags.  Use a different argument each time.  Only someone possessing the *actual skill* of ignoring emotional red flags and zeroing in on the one mistaken part of the complex argument will be able to object to the correct part of your statement, identifying them as a co-conspirator.  Likewise only a conspirator would be able to construct a complex multi-part argument containing exactly one real flaw.

Brienne and I do 1-4, I know a couple that consensually does 6 on a long-term romantic basis, and I'm not sure what you mean by 5.

However 1-4 are defining qualities of *rational romance in real life*.  Fiction is about conflict, no exceptions.  I suspect that a good rational romance *story* would need some *actually good reason* for clear communication to not occur, such as somebody being a secret agent.

"Rationalist Fiction".  Though it also seems that eaturbrainz has a different concept of what this is about than [I did](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/).  Plenty of SF, including all 'hard' SF, aspires to lawful worldbuilding.  Plenty of mystery novels aspire to be fair puzzles.  Plenty of litfic aspires to GrayVsGrey morality (something I find profoundly uninteresting which is why there are phoenixes and Dementors in HPMOR).  Rationalist fiction is distinguished from existing genres by its ability to exhibit useful explicit cognitive skills, which in turn *requires* that good thinking not be an Informed Ability.  Munchkinism is a major feature of HPMOR and its derived works and is itself a useful cognitive ability; you could also handwave a lot and try to trace it back to Null-A, though I'm not sure you should.

But to be *rational* is something that many people would say their literature aspires to, and that's not at all the same as *explicitly rationalist*.

&gt; "I will remark," Dumbledore said while Harry was still trying to sort out how to reply to this completely unexpected rejoinder, "that it is a common misconception of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there, leaving none for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw indicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which is not at all the same quality as being intelligent."

At no point should an FAI have decision-making discretion to make a potentially long-term catastrophic change to its own code unless you have driven the conditionally independent component of the failure probability down to nearly zero.  In other words, good AIs that don't know how to modify their own code correctly should not modify any portion of their code that can switch them to being evil, and young AIs that cannot with great precision calculate what they do not know should not have the capacity to execute such changes.

Sorry, the soul (inner listener / thing that makes you you) divides and goes into all future branches equally.  You know how you have an inner listener at time 6pm, and an inner listener at time 7pm, and there's something that makes them the same person even though they don't share the same experiences?  Well, there's more than one inner listener at 7pm which has a thread going back to the inner listener at 6pm, and they don't share experiences any more than you see at 7pm exactly what you saw 20 years ago.  http://lesswrong.com/lw/r9/quantum_mechanics_and_personal_identity/

No, there simply *isn't* an answer to the question "Which branch will I experience?" except "All of them."  An omniscient being knows the exact state of reality, that is, the exact state of the wavefunction containing their present and all of their future selves.

&gt; "My own approach is usually to identify the different desires, give them names, conceive of them as separate individuals, and let them argue it out inside my head. So far the main persistent ones are my Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin sides, my Inner Critic, and my simulated copies of you, Neville, Draco, Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Professor Quirrell, Dad, Mum, Richard Feynman, and Douglas Hofstadter."

The Defense Professor always fails to return the next year.  Sometimes because he's fired due to misdemeanors.  But from Harry's perspective that expectation has already been explained-away and is no longer acting as an explanandum making "Quirrell will be arrested" substantially more likely.

Risky?  Yes.  As stupid as it sounds to a 20th-century First World Muggle?  No.  According to my calculations from the implied size of Hogwarts, the population of magical Britain is on the order of 10,000.  Imagine Minister Fudge as a small-town mayor rather than the equivalent of the U.S. president, and Lucius Malfoy as being the wealthiest man in that small town rather than Carlos Slim.  Suddenly canon makes a lot more sense, right? 

Now ask yourself how well your instincts calibrated for the U.S. legal system will actually carry over to that small town, if it were an entire country.

So what Harry did in forming his own contract, using a book and his own judgment of that book's complexity, was certainly risky.  But he didn't have very much choice, and it wasn't analogous to a similar act committed by a Muggle in the world you know, which would indeed be entirely and completely stupid.

The transition between many newbies to /r/HPMOR asking "Is Quirrell evil?" and many folk on /r/HPMOR deciding that Harry holds the Idiot Ball for not believing that Quirrell is evil appears to me have taken place without Harry being exposed, in-story, to much in the way of *new* strong evidence thereof.  So far as I can tell, this shift in /r/HPMOR's attitude mainly happened during the interregnum between chapters.  So far as I can tell, the HPMOR community debated this for literally a couple of years, then began to graduate toward collectively believing that Quirrell is evil, primarily updating on story events that Harry never saw and using out-world facts not available to Harry.  And only *then* decided that Quirrell's evil should be obvious to Harry and that he was holding the Idiot Ball.  As needed, I could collect and exhibit literally hundreds of earlier comments, reviews, and forum posts asking "Is Quirrell really evil?"  Possibly thousands.

I was disappointed.  The basic theme to me seemed to be "SW gets all the technology *and* all the smart people, ST gets none" and this is *particularly* annoying because, at least in the early seasons of TNG which are what I watched, TNG aspired to be more intelligent than SW.

&gt; I would assume that this is simply a fairly minor writing mistake... except that Harry mentions a few chapters **earlier** that it may have been right for Dumbledore to deliberately leak the prophecy to Voldemort, in the hopes that he be immediately defeated.

Visualize trying to include that argument in Ch. 39.  Not only would it have interfered with the thematic flow, but Harry would have *won* the argument for reasons appearing obvious in retrospect, which would have weakened Dumbledore's appearance further.

Malthusian arguments against immortality are flawed in our world, but for non-obvious reasons (molecular nanotech / two immortals having two children is linear growth / AI implies you don't need natural selection to improve mind designs).  Malthusian arguments against growth are *transparently* flawed in a world with *Aguamente*.

Paul-Ehrlich-style arguments would also be culturally out of character for Albus Dumbledore, since they only became popular in the Muggle world around the 1960s and there's no obvious reason why they'd extend over to the wizard world at all.  Arthur Weasley doesn't know who Paul Ehrlich is, Cornelius Fudge certainly doesn't know who Paul Ehrlich is, and I doubt that Lily Potter got around to learning who Paul Ehrlich was.

Most importantly at all, an argument like this says, "Oh, eternal life *would* be nice, if not for this here disadvantage, and if we could get rid of that eternal life would be fine."  Most deathists won't notice that; from their perspective, any argument against immortality is just a soldier fighting on their side, something that confirms the negative affect they assign.  My model of Dumbledore *would* notice a fine logical distinction like that, because not all the smart children are Sorted into Ravenclaw.

But of course if you're currently deathist you currently think that Ehlich/Malthus-style 'resource limitation' is a knockdown argument, you probably haven't taken the additional step to see that it's *trivially* non-knockdown in a world with Rowling-style magic, and so Dumbledore is mysteriously refusing to use what *everyone* knows is the obvious argument against immortality.  Clearly he's a strawman.  Sigh.

There is no guarantee written into science that you will like the answer the experiments give you.  Harry has tested many hypotheses, within and without the text.  Except in a few cases, the answer has been, "You're wrong" or "That didn't work."  When progress does occur, it tends to leverage existing knowledge rather than come out of nowhere, and not solve everything at once.

Which is how Science actually works outside of comic books, and I made an effort to show that.

Science is universal, and the same discoveries are made by the people with the same names, in the same numerical year under the local calendar system, across every alternate reality.  In Middle-Earth there was still somebody named Kahneman and he published on the conjunction fallacy in 1983 of the Third Age, shortly after the Dwarves awakened Durin's Bane in Moria.

One of the disadvantages of publishing _Methods of Rationality_ is that I've acquired a large, active hatedom among people who don't like my particular kind of Harry Potter fanfiction, who energetically go about spreading lies on the Internet.  Essentially everything in your comment is flat-out wrong.  (Representative sample:  The "autobiography" is a 90K-self-description written by the 16-year-old version of myself.  It was taken off the Internet, and then my large hatedom found a copy on archive.org, which I couldn't disable because the domain name was gone.  The document makes around as much sense as anything you wrote when you were 16, I suppose; I long ago disowned it, along with most other things I wrote at 16.  The hatedom goes on quoting it and I would invite you to consider how it would feel if this applied to everything you ever said when you were 16.  Other components of hate are at a similar level of accuracy.)

On Oct 17th I'll be giving a talk at MIT (the CSAIL Colloquium if that means anything to you) on recent progress coming out of MIRI's workshops (where we have a fair number of traditional academic attendees), covering [this paper](http://intelligence.org/files/RobustCooperation.pdf), [this paper](http://intelligence.org/files/TilingAgents.pdf), and time permitting [this paper](http://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Christiano-et-al-Naturalistic-reflection-early-draft.pdf).  This seems like an adequate and complete refutation of your comment.  I hope that your hate has been acquired secondhand and that you are not too reluctant to relinquish it in the face of your contrary evidence.

In principle, but to be entirely honest, the moment I thought "If Harry can cut a hole in the wall of Azkaban, then so can a powerful wizard, therefore they have Aurors on broomsticks" I *immediately* thought of using a rocket.

That pretty much *is* the common view of the Great Stagnation where I come from - that there's plenty of science left to do, but society is bad at doing it.  Yes, this contrasts to Tyler Cowen's hypothesis about the cause of GS, but the definition of GS is (objectively) annual growth in total factor productivity going from 0.75% to 0.25% (i.e. falling off a cliff) in the 1970s, and (generalizing) a supposed slowdown in science and technology, not necessarily of specified cause.  I think "We are running out of science" is a terrible explanation and certainly should not be the first line of recourse with so many other plausible causes.

In the depths of the Great Stagnation, all remaining significant technological progress occurs because some ascended post-exit Silicon Valley mogul decides to spend their own money or their own corporation's money on it, out of the goodness of their hearts.

&gt; The realization that he was being stupid hit Harry like a blow to the stomach. He didn't need mirrors to send a message, he hadn't needed mirrors since January. 

Though I expect JKR hadn't decided until book 7(?) that the Patronus Charm could be used to send messages.

Different people *demand* different things, and flee from different flaws.  The set of things I can properly enjoy is strictly limited to those where at least one character, or the author, surpasses a certain level of... we may as well use a new word, like 'shadarak', because I don't think the standard literary conceptual lexicon contains a ready-made idea that corresponds to what I think of as 'intelligence'.  (It doesn't have anything to do with being able to invent fancy gadgets, for example, and would manifest in *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* as a background level of genre savviness.)  Works with sufficient shadarak simply are the works I can read at all - regardless of what else might be wrong with them, or whether they needlessly use &lt;&gt; for Japanese formatting, etc.

*blink blink*

So gwern used the phrase "Aumannian reasoning", and it was assumed that clearly everyone on LW uses this term.

I observed that this is not consistent with the fact that Google turns up no hits for "Aumannian reasoning" on LW.

You cite *my response* as a case of generalizing from one example?

I'm not sure where the thingy started where anything done by any one person who posts to LW is taken to be characteristic of all LWers everyone (I have seen many examples of this), but I'm starting to get a much more visceral appreciation of the notion of "racial stereotyping".

I try to avert, reverse, or deconstruct tropes where I can, but Unspoken Plans exist for a *reason.*  They don't even have to be successful, by the way; it's just that sometimes, telling the reader what the plan is would be a spoiler.  It's more of a literary mechanic than a trope.  Imagine Harry explaining everything that would happen in Ch. 98, to Lucius in Ch. 97; I believe the phrase is No, Just No.

Possibly with more writing skill I could avoid the appearance of unspoken plans, or make them less obtrusive (e.g. when Neil Gaiman does this in Sandman Vol IV, with Lucifer not saying what's going to happen in Hell, you would have to be reeeally on the lookout to spot it).  But meanwhile, I cannot really apologize for this literary mechanic.

That doesn't give you a self-consistent loop.  Iterating will more likely reach a 1-2-3-1-2-3 loop than a 1-1-1 loop, plus this is the implicit model Harry's number-factoring algorithm runs on and that did not return the anticipated experimental result.

The fundamental problem with "It was all just a sim" from a story perspective is much the same as trying to use it as an explanation in the real world, for some real-world phenomenon - the hypothesis is equally good at explaining everything, and so explains nothing.

*Which* apparent violations of otherwise-universal law take place, in which direction?  If you can't further constrain expectations using the hypothesis, you haven't gained anything by postulating it.  The reader can't use such a hypothesis to solve the story - and it doesn't help solve real life, either.

"It's interference in a sim" is isomorphic to "Anything could happen" or "Otherwise universal laws may sometimes be violated, but I won't tell you which ones, when, or what you'll see happen after that."

My own remark to this post:  Criticism of how the story currently *looks* may perhaps be fair; that's something I often screw up my attempted control of, for I am not a perfect writer.  To claim that I, the author, had certain intentions or mental states, when the story is not yet finished, and I may not yet reply; to this I do object, and call it unfair.  Feminists are not exempt from that consideration, nor from accusations that they may have violated it; and neither am I exempt, and neither is anyone else.

FYI:  Much, much larger explosions than this should occur naturally in the Sun all the time, so it's exceedingly unlikely that this would work.  Crank flags in the paper, too (the author repeatedly cites himself and something he named after himself).

If it would work, of course, publishing it openly would make Professor Quirrell frown at you.  **Opinions of characters are not my own** but I have to say, in this particular case it's hard to see how explaining to dictators how they could blow up the Sun would serve humanity rather than the author's ego.

Time-Turners aren't just fragile in canon, they're fragile in hundreds (maybe thousands) of other fan-fictions, and I'd yet to read one where somebody says "Maybe we should put a protective shell on it."  There is much that happens in HPMOR because I'd never seen it done before and yet it seems obvious, e.g. when you call together Dumbledore and the Head Auror to look at a rat, it's just a rat, or the troll is loose in Hogwarts and it is not the case that nobody gets hurt.

* A 3-dimensional character contains at least two 2-dimensional characters in conflict.  [(More detail.)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hpx/how_to_write_deep_characters/)

* Orson Scott Card observed that a conflict between Good and Evil isn't half as interesting as a conflict between Good and Good.  This doesn't mean your villains are sympathetic.  It means both sides have such strong arguments that afterward your readers are still arguing about who was right.  By far the simplest way to write a conflict like this is to pick a moral issue *you yourself* are still unsure about as the centerpiece, and write the conflicting arguments as the story.  [(More detail.)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hpx/how_to_write_deep_characters/)

* Make the story awesome.  Deliver hedons to the reader.  Sure, have deep emotional issues and character growth, but don't neglect to strap a rocket engine to a broomstick either.

* You cannot write intelligent characters without respecting their intelligence.  In fact, you can't write intelligent characters unless you respect the concept of intelligence in general.  There are a lot more rules than this for writing intelligence, but this is one of the primary ones.

* If writing fanfiction, be certain that any advantages given the protagonist come with compensating buffs to the villains, or other story obstacles, to maintain tension.  You can't make Frodo a Jedi without giving Sauron the Death Star.  Got it?  Good, now apply the same lesson to your original fiction.

* Originality isn't easy, but it is simple.  Just don't do stuff that's already been done.  Whenever you find yourself completing an idea in the obvious way, pause, go back, and find a non-obvious way to complete the idea instead.

* As a writer you possess the power of time travel.  Any time you spot a problem in the text, do not try to fix it in a future paragraph.  Go back in time and prevent the problem from happening in the first place.

* Special case of the above:  In every story, the proper order in which to present causality is A-&gt;B, then A, then B.  In a Riddle/Hermione shipping fic, do not show Riddle acting dominant toward Hermione, then Hermione falling for him, then explain that Hermione felt Ron wasn't man enough for her.  That's A, then B, then a frantic attempt persuade the reader that A-&gt;B.  First show Hermione thinking that Ron is a lovely man but she sometimes wishes he would display a little more ambition, then have her interact with Riddle after being thrown back in time, then have her fall in love.  A-&gt;B, then A, then B.  The reader must have a mental model in which A would imply B by the time that A happens.  Otherwise you're trying to patch afterward a problem, reader disbelief, that you should have fixed by going back in time.

* Any time the paragraphs in your story don't seem to flow correctly, ask yourself about the level of tension in each paragraph.  Is it high, then suddenly low, then high again?  Is it low, then suddenly high, then low again?

* The Illusion of Transparency is an overshadowing fact of writing - what you thought were blatant clues will be assigned interpretations you never even thought of by a reader who doesn't know what you have in mind, or just missed entirely because you were too subtle.  Use this power to your advantage by having some forces in your story which are never directly observed, and then write with complete frankness about their effects, throwing in as many clues and hints as you like, so long as you don't use cliches about what the clues are hinting at.  When the Big Reveal comes, the readers will be properly astonished as they realized they managed to miss it all despite there being so many clues.

* A standard rule is that you will need to write and polish one million words that are no good before writing anything good.  I tried to write my first novel at age nine.  At age thirteen I was writing Barney the Dinosaur vs. Star Trek fanfiction that was probably around as good as the median fanfiction on fanfiction.net.  Eventually I got good enough to start meeting my own standards.  The standard advice is to write, write, write.

* In the service of the above:  There is no such thing as writer's block, there is only holding yourself to too high a standard.  You can always write one more sentence, unless you're being too picky about what that sentence says.

* Write material that you will enjoy writing, especially while working on your first million words.

* If you're going to be serious, buy a copy of Scrivener.  No.  Seriously.  Do it.  I don't buy software either, but I bought that one.

* Reading nonfiction books on how to write fiction is surprisingly helpful.  Many people who achieve excellence want to explain how to others how to follow in their footsteps, but can't manage to explain it.  The exception to this rule, amazingly enough, is excellent writers, who often *can* explain to you what they learned because that's a writing problem.

1-6 is true.  7 I'm not sure of.  8 is entirely wrong, as I found out the hard way in Methods of Rationality.  My God, the protests if the story reveals something the readers would rather be kept in suspense about.  Thankfully I only made that mistake once, accepted that the readers were right, and quickly corrected it.

If I answer that question, it will be as a Facebook post and certainly not here.  Many comments *exemplified* hate in somewhat diluted form, but that's not the same as explaining the psychology.  I'm not confident I understand exactly what's happening, but keep in mind that I contain Professor Quirrell as a strict subsystem of myself, and my understanding of human motives is thus lower-bounded.

An extremely good point.  I need to fix one of those two chapters.  I will have to think about this.  An obvious idea would be that Voldemort obtained the password to wards which otherwise would have detected him, *a la* Moody's idea about Voldemort's attack on the Monroes.  Any better reader suggestions?

EDIT:  Ch. 29 has been updated - it should hit FF.net shortly and propagate to hpmor.com eventually.  Sirius Black is now allegedly the one who let Voldemort into the Potters' home, somehow.

Oh, the exact particular part where PQ is talking about meddling dabblers who talk about safety but can't stop, is channeling me about AI development *only*.  Though actually sacrificial rituals can't have been *that* bad (yet) or their world wouldn't still be there, so maybe advanced biotech or nanotech would be in the same safety class if it could be done by individual mad scientists with a chip on their shoulders.  And I don't particularly expect Vassar would disagree with PQ about the meddling dabblers and their folly, except that both of us would be more pessimistic and cynical than the margins of that story could reasonably contain.

A better summary would be that there was an improperly issued death certificate, a meddling coroner, an overreacting county government, a SWAT raid, a legal case, a suit for false arrest and seizure by Alcor, and eventually a $90,000 settlement paid out by the county to Alcor.

An asteroid cloud is heading toward Earth.  It will periodically reduce whole nations to flames, after which they will regrow.  This could partially help prevent 1984 from occurring, since it would be harder for any one nation to have an everlasting government.  But this is a rather tiny silver lining amid the flames, the screams, the destroyed houses and factories, whole nations dying in firestorms like that which once consumed Hamburg, and in fact is a rather odd thing to focus on when we're talking about putting the whole Earth into constant fear of you and your family and your whole country being destroyed by falling giant space rocks, whereupon whichever country grows up after you will also be destroyed.  It makes everlasting dictatorships harder, but that's a strange thing to focus on when so many other good things also become harder.

This analogy is exact.

If and only if Hermione becomes an alicorn princess, it is also true that anyone who figures out what happened to Harry's pet rock will thereby have solved the ultimate secret of HPMOR.  The mutual revision of these now-linked probabilities is left as an exercise to the reader.

It does very little good to preserve the semantics of the utility function if the AI updates its beliefs in an anti-Bayesian/anti-inductive direction to conclude that, e.g., cyanide is very healthy for people - behaviors are products of the whole AI.  (Any aspect of the AI which never modifies its behavior can be omitted from the AI.)  You have the correct general idea, but proving that an intelligent agent is trying to optimize the same goals using probably better planning and world-modeling under some criterion of bounded rationality, is a tad more ambitious than proving a piece of code has the same input-output mapping while heuristically believing that it runs faster.  Commonality, yes, but not enough that you could solve the problem by looking up optimizing compiler techniques.

I haven't lost half my friends to wars, so my life is not his.  It's more that Godric Gryffindor is the *only* character in HPMOR such that anything said by Godric may safely be assumed to be the opinion of the author, or such that his life choices are always ones that I would endorse given his circumstances.  Obviously such a character cannot exist in the same era as the actual story.

Worth noting:  David Brin is a heavy explicit influence on me w/r/t philosophy of SF&amp;F.

On this exact point, though, I kind of *do* think society is an idiot.  I mean, society has alcohol legal and marijuana illegal and the European Central Bank is letting NGDP collapse.  But it is definitely possible to overstate the incompetence of society (the Federal Reserve did not actually allow another Great Depression).  The fact that in canon!HP no democratic institution ever does anything useful, just powerful individual wizards and their followers, may or may not be *realistic* but either way it at least ought to be *lampshaded* vide Ch. 35.  I think it is actually quite realistic with respect to many realistic circumstances.  The goverments of the modern world are certainly major landscape-dominating actors but they are not necessarily useful ones with respect to many particular problems.

Start with 2 characters.  Work out what both of them would logically do.  Then write only one character's viewpoint.  Don't try at all to obscure the second character's reasoning or motivation, in fact, drop in as many hints as you like.  Due to the Illusion of Transparency the readers will construct an additional 20 plots besides the one you have in mind and will be quite shocked at the final revelation.

After reading the comments I feel the need to mention several important points:

1)  Use positive conditioning, not punishments.  Punishments should be used very sparingly because they also train you not to condition yourself.  I should perhaps A/N this in the fic.

2)  Make sure you actually *want* whatever is being used as the reinforcer.  Chocolate is linked with guilt for many people.  I can't successfully use chocolate.  Jumping in the air and saying "Yay!" (even if this makes you feel silly at first) works for many people.

3)  Reinforcing images that connect to the task work even better.  E.g. thinking "Bayesian Master!" when you successfully execute a rationality technique.

4)  There is an ongoing debate about whether to try to reward performance or outperformance, I lean toward the latter.  I.e. I would think "Bayesian Master!" on trying to execute an ambitious rationality technique or a difficult or painful or novel one, less so for a routine performance.

To be clear, I know very well that Daphne et. al. are arguing points of the feminism that every woman I know who self-describes as 'feminist' espouses.  But when Hermione presumes to challenge Hannah's right to pursue Neville however she wishes, that is, illegitimizing a woman's desire in the name of feminism, she is engaging in bad 'feminism', and this is actually a thing, especially on the Internet, albeit not in my immediate local community.  Such were they who called Clarisse Thorn a fun feminist and somehow did not mean it as a compliment.  That's why I say it's a critique *within* feminism and not a critique *of* feminism, i.e., a critique by one kind of feminism of a different thing claiming to be feminism.  This wasn't intended to say that Hermione's error is a majority among self-described 'feminists' (I actually have no idea what the statistics are here).  But surely the error of "But your desire as a woman isn't properly feminist!" exists and is widespread to some statistical degree and is not straw and can still benefit from being fought.  And yes, the humor here is Daphne et. al. spontaneously inventing better feminism, on the spot, in response to Hermione's innocent misunderstanding of feminism.

It's possible that the rant itself may have come across the wrong way, but I'm not sure.  Obviously Daphne et. al. have not the slightest idea what Hermione is talking about, but Hermione herself is not going to be a very sophisticated feminist either at this point, and I would say that Daphne, Lavender, and Padma are basically, um, right?  In extremely oversimplified ways.  Women should be able to persue MOTAS in whatever fashion they like, witches getting to do whatever they want sounds like more fun, and it should really just be about more women becoming whatever it is they're trying to become at the moment.  I mean obviously you're not going to get a sophisticated presentation of both sides in this particular format.

I also find it really, really hard to conceptualize anyone who uses 'fun' as a term of disapproval as anything but a Knight Templar style supervillain.  Fun is the point of the universe.  My presentation of my moral philosophy of eudaimonia was entitled Fun Theory.

If the rule is strongly enforced there must be an extremely limited number of Time-Turners in the world, because existing on the same planet for the appropriate fraction of a second is a causal interaction.  So instead I made the rule oddly fuzzy, but that was a forced move.

No offense to you personally but that is the worst rule of fantasy fiction ever.  The protagonists' magic does anything the author has previously shown or told you that it can, ONLY.

NPC and antagonist magic can do things not previously shown or told, but PC magic must be circumscribed in advance for the story to be solvable.  Like, imagine this chapter with a *Trollus Killus* spell we've never seen Harry use before.  That would be... I have trouble describing how terrible that would be.

Without endorsing any part of this comment dealing with events which have yet to take place, I congratulate 75th on LessWrong (/u/75thTrombone I think) for [this comment on LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/bfo/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/6aih).

Which, when I first saw it, was downvoted to... I forget, -6 or something.  Going by the percentage score, at least 11 people downvoted it.  Apparently people didn't like the tone of apparent certainty with which 75th spoke.  Sounded uppity to them, I guess.

I wanted to say something at the time about that, and how penalizing people for sounding certain or uppity can potentially lead you to ignore people who are **actually competent,** but I couldn't, at that time.  All I could say was "Why are people downvoting this?  It's a testable prediction" whereupon it climbed up to +3 again.

What fascinates me about this graph is the obvious cliche effect.  Is Hermione a less interesting character than Hedwig?  No, but if you're just starting out and about to write something that sinks forever into obscurity, you're much more likely to write a Hermione-centric story than a Hedwig-centric story.

Theoretically, among rational agents the correct decision-theoretic response to most threats is to ignore them because the person has no incentive to make them if they don't believe you'll respond.  This isn't a threat, it's an obvious behavior pattern that I have to adopt if certain other conditions hold, I have to do that whether or not anyone 'ignores the threat' - it's not a condition I'm imposing in hopes of causing a behavior change.  Publication errors happened once and could happen again, if their effects are then further magnified in such fashion I have to be much more conservative in writing Author's Notes.

To be clear about conditional policies, if the community said "We like leaks!" then I'd react by trying to make surer that Wordpress didn't prepublish things and wouldn't pull the gun on censoring Author's Notes until a *second* leak happened, in which case I would conclude that I was incompetent to prevent such things from happening without more effort than I wanted to invest, and switch to saying potentially spoilery things that used to be in the Author's Notes within my personal Facebook feed only after the chapters were published.

I have, after a lot of agonizing over the last day, deleted this comment for now and I request a more communal policy debate about whether you prefer that such accidental info leaks propagate or not propagate within the subreddit, keeping in mind that my own policies will change in response (not as a threat, just as an adaptation to whatever you decide).

Wordpress is dumb sometimes.  Can I ask for things like this *not* to be posted to the subreddit if I make an error?  Especially not any information from the Note itself, even if it seems innocuous to you?  I write these in advance so they can go up simultaneously, and this type of condition if a Wordpress silliness occurs means that I'll be censoring them.  Accidentally leaking to somebody who saw something for 3 seconds is one thing, but it's a much worse problem if there's a large subreddit to populate any info leaks to the most interested and active readers.

Or to put it a bit more bluntly, if this happens a single additional time there will be never again be any remark in the Author's Notes that could conceivably be any kind of spoiler whatsoever for any chapters that have not yet posted at the time I'm pre-writing the Notes.  I wouldn't like that either but I'd have no other choice.

I was on transhumanist mailing lists for roughly fifteen years before I wrote that Sequence, watching debates about personal identity and personal continuity and is it the real you if you're not the same atoms, go around and around and around and around and around the same damn way every damn year.  This gives me good reason to believe there is *not* anything I can say in a paragraph that will answer you, and that it *does* take a big hammer.  I wrote that Sequence to finally take a giant hammer and squish the issue.  It only works for people who can read Sequences, but so it goes.  It's better than having *nothing* to settle the issue, even for people who are willing to read.

If I'd known and comprehended TV Tropes when I did the Sequences - I'm not sure it existed back then - I would've known to use a separate wiki (as now exists, too late) and link Wiki summaries of concepts each time I used that concept in a blog post, and link to posts on concepts from the Wiki, instead of linking blog posts from blog posts.

As it stands, the disorganization of the Sequences is the price of trying to write at a rate of one blog post per day.  My trying to write things as Official Books means you'd have gotten maybe 10% as much material over the same period of time.  All things have cost-benefit tradeoffs.  So at least when I write them, a given property you don't like is probably the result of a cost-benefit tradeoff, not me deliberately trying to annoy you, being lazy, forgetting about something, etcetera.

There should be different words for "living for ten thousand years", "living for  a trillion years", "living for amounts of time that can only be represented using the fast-growing hierarchy at highly recursive ordinals", and "living forever".  These roughly correspond to:

* Living at least up to your present self's limit of being able to imagine experiences that seem worth having, so that you don't die with anything your present self would consider undone, though you might still die with many things your future self considers undone;
* Living as long as a universe could reasonably be expected to last, long enough that your mind has to expand to godlike size, beyond anything your current-day self could imagine, even though there might be a smooth incremental path all along the way.
* Living way, way, way the hell longer than that, so that when you finally die your future self's regret at all the things then apprehended, which are still left undone, is mathematically incomprehensible to your present-day self.
* Not dying, ever.

You'd be concerned here with the second two, both of which require that our present-day apprehension of physics be substantially mistaken or incomplete in order to be possible.

This is the assumption I've been using but note that in reality, if a first-world-style low-population-growth situation persisted for literally a thousand years, it is very plausible that a small fraction of families with a genetically or culturally non-zero-heritable tendency toward wanting more children would soon dominate the population equation.

We can, but once you observe part of a universe, the rules you encoded for compressing it determine what counts as a short message when inventing new hypotheses about the rest.  This is why an afterlife is certainly, indisputably far more likely in Harry's observably magical universe than in ours, just not (as said) &gt;50% likely on Harry's evidence.

There's a difference between using academic evolutionary psychology as a boost to help structure your purely factual model of people's minds, and (from the linked post above) "So I broke up with Alice over a long conversation that included an hour-long primer on evolutionary psychology in which I explained how natural selection had built me to be attracted to certain features that she lacked. I thought she would appreciate this because she had previously expressed admiration for detailed honesty. Now I realize that there's hardly a more damaging way to break up with someone. She asked that I kindly never speak to her again, and I can't blame her."

Because when male wannabe rationalists screw up romance, mentioning evolutionary psychology is involved a surprising amount of the time.

&gt; if you walked into your room to find your computer with a burned out motherboard, half your photos etched into the wall of the room and a faulty and more limited but still working copy of your computer 3D printed in the corner, running without any apparent power feed. Would "oh it's just an electricity surge as the computer failed" really be a likely explanation or one which really explains anything which you've seen? 

Indeed.  But then one must proceed to ask, why does snipping one circuit of the computer result in a functional change as would be predicted if that circuit were indeed computing...

At this point we're hard up against the limit of a ficton's behavior having been ultimately generated by humans in our universe makin' stuff up about ghosts, without there being any coherent set of fundamental laws underlying real actual ghosts.  If we ignore that and proceed anyway, then yes, souls are far *more* likely in that ficton than they are in our universe, as are all other magical and supernatural hypotheses.  That's not the same as a probability over 50%.

&gt; If you cannot assign a truth value to a statement, isn't it just as invalid to write in 0 as to write in 1? Mustn't it be left as unknown?

I think this is the core of the difficulty.  You're using "left as unknown" in a way that doesn't make sense to a Bayesian, who has to assign betting odds to everything.  There are only probabilities.  Some are high.  Some are low.  To formally evaluate the prior probability of an unobservable afterlife you would have to write out the smallest computer program (or causal system) that implements an unobservable afterlife on top of the observable world, measure the number of bits, and raise 0.5 to that power.  Now it doesn't matter that we haven't written out the program because we can see just by glancing at the calculation procedure that the prior probability is going to end up small in the absence of evidence.  Most prior probabilities for specific things happening should end up small, and the prior probabilities for those specific things not happening should end up large, in the absence of evidence, when those specific things are not default extrapolations from the rules that are supported by the observable parts of our model.  It's how I know there are no chocolate cakes left behind by dying stars, even though nothing we can observe with modern telescopes distinguishes between the states of the universe with and without such chocolate cake.  Chocolate cake isn't super incredibly complex and it's too small for our telescopes to see it if it were there, but in the absence of any specific reason to expect chocolate cake to be left behind by a dying star, the prior probability of presence is small, and the prior probability of absence large.

Roughly, the way Bayesian probability works is that hypotheses start out with a prior probability that diminishes as the exponential of their complexity (1/2 to the power of the number of bits, which ensures that the sum over all hypotheses works out to something finite).  Hypotheses that lack support or antisupport keep their prior probabilities, and these prior probabilities will usually be tiny by any everyday standard, since the sum over literally *everything possible* and mutually exclusive over any given question has to work out to 1 or less.

By the standard origin of anti-epistemology, since there's a lot of beliefs that people want you to believe without any evidence, there's some false 'common wisdom' to the effect that if there's no evidence against something you are allowed to believe it, or it is respectable to believe it, or you ought to act as if it has equal probability of being true or untrue.  This, of course, is flat wrong as probability theory.  Like 'everyone has the right to their own opinion', the phrase 'But it might be true' or 'you can't disprove it' is not something said by someone who's trying to apply procedures that differentiate between truth and falsehood in favor of the truth, but rather someone else trying to prevent such procedures from operating.

Mencius Moldbug is not a basis of Professor Quirrell, but I'm aware of Moldbug's existence.  See also http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/ which is probably the best explanation I've heard so far of what this whole "Reaction" thing is about.

PQ's political philosophy here isn't from Michael Vassar or Robin Hanson in particular (PQ's usual bases for cynicism).  It's more along the lines of my noticing, and wishing to highlight, that in the original HP the elected democratic government never does anything useful and only powerful wizards ever make a difference.  There's no Allied wizard countries that beat the Wizard Nazis, instead Dumbledore defeats Grindelwald in a duel.  This is not necessarily unrealistic in a world of wands; and many would say that democratic Muggle goverments, though not effectless, are evil in their effects; but the issue does deserve to not be allowed to fade into mere background assumptions.

Of course this is merely the Opinion of God, since that which is not in the text itself is only one person's viewpoint.

&gt; tl;dr: Saying AK is the most powerful spell we know is not a sufficient argument. Because no matter how many spells Merlin took away, there will always be one that is most powerful.

But even if all spells outside the Interdict have power below some upper bound, there could still be an infinite series of spells approaching a limiting power which is never reached!

Holy crap, what a lack of sympathy.

Eliezer Yudkowsky here, author of *An Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning*, still one of the leading online introductions to Bayes's Theorem despite being, in retrospect, complete crap because I had no idea how to explain math when I wrote it.

Fungah, you're right that your homework problems aren't preparing you to do mathematical reasoning.  Your teacher probably has no fucking idea how to teach mathematical reasoning to anyone who isn't already good at it.  I expect that she is convinced, by the typical mind fallacy, that all you need to do is practice the homework problems, since *she* could look at the homework problems and pick up the general trick.  I used to think the same way, but by the third time I tried teaching math to someone who wasn't already good at it, I was disabused of the notion.  However most human beings lack the capacity to learn from experience, and I doubt your teacher is any exception.

I'm not sure what you can do about this; I've never seen a good formula for teaching mathematical reasoning ability to people who aren't already good at math.  I could recommend books like Martin Gardner's _Aha: Gotcha_ and _Aha: Insight_ but I suspect those might also work only for people who are already good at math (still worth a shot, but don't keep trying if it's not working).

One piece of advice I'm sorry to have to give you is that if the purpose of these classes is *to prepare for a comp sci. degree* then you should probably give that up now, unless you've already verified that you possess strong levels of programming talent.  (Glance at any piece of code from any Python tutorial.  If this glance is giving you a pretty good idea of how to write small programs in Python, you should be a computer programmer.  If you have no idea what it is you just looked at, you will never be a *good, happy* computer programmer and should pursue a different career.  I would expect this to correlate strongly to the magical ability to pick up word problems from solving formal problems, but could perhaps be mistaken.)

In the end, you're running up against a limit of what the school system knows how to teach, and while an exceptional teacher might be able to help you, this one can't.  You can try Kahn Academy, maybe, but mostly it sounds like you're out of luck.  And even if you solve this particular class, you'll probably still be out of luck when it comes to becoming a good and happy computer programmer later.  Unlike almost every other branch of human endeavor where practice and hard work is what counts - unlike chess, tennis, writing fiction, sex, almost anything else - people who start out confused by computer programs will mostly never be good professionals in the field no matter how much they practice.  In this one part of life, unlike almost any other, there really is such a thing as an innate talent you either have or don't - at least relative to anything anyone knows about how to teach it.

(*Advanced* computer programming, *good* computer programming, is a matter of study and practice just like almost everything else.  The ability to write computer programs *at all* is a mysterious special gear, and its presence or absence will manifest almost immediately.)

I'd have a lot more tolerance for RW if they didn't seem to have a style of 'hur, hur' anti-intellectual mockery *toward things like Solomonoff induction*.  Obviously I heart the living daylights out of Richard Dawkins, Martin Gardner, and all the other great classics of just pounding the crap out of homeopathy.  But can you imagine Richard Dawkins mocking somebody for the crime of trying to use more math than he did?  If Richard Dawkins didn't like your math, he'd bloody well sit down and analyze your math until he could refute it as math, or bring in a friend who could, and *then* he'd mock it after carefully getting the formal refutation out of the way.  Type 1 skepticism is fine.  Anti-intellectual skepticism is not.  And if you teach people that there's nothing more to rejecting astrology than getting together with their friends and engaging in some fun mockery - hey, why not direct it at that bit of math or that physics hypothesis, too? - then you haven't really taught them anything at all.

Mm, just checking around for a good example that isn't them specifically making fun of those nerdy Bayesian guys, try:

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quantum_collapse#Many-worlds_interpretation

which is an issue I often use as a quick litmus check on the competence of wannabe type-2 skeptics, since MWI "sounds weird" and is easy to make fun of if you don't understand what it's about, but the technical debate involves (a) some amount of real knowledge of quantum mechanics and (b) some amount of epistemology-with-math.  In the RW article we find:

&gt; The many-worlds interpretation is nice fodder for science fiction stories, but there are some glaring issues with it. 

Aw, that's cute.  (Pats RW on the head.)  Maybe someday you'll grow up and put something about [Minimum Message Length](http://lesswrong.com/lw/q3/mwi_is_simple/) or [Solomonoff induction](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jp/occams_razor/) in your [page on Occam's Razor](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

Comparing the RW and LW pages on quantum mechanics will give you a pretty good idea of why I think RW is a genuinely valuable resource for people who need help breaking loose from astrology, but isn't remotely ready to contribute to the advance of human knowledge by discriminating among open controversies.  Unfortunately, like a lot of type 1 skeptics, RW has no idea that one of these is more difficult than the other.

&gt; Instead, it's the second type of skepticism that holds my interest: skepticism about things that aren't obviously wrong.

Yeah, but this kind of skepticism is *really hard*, it's basically on the same order of difficulty as coming up with new, previously unknown true facts.  If you can take a large set of new propositions and reliably cast out all the false ones, you would be left with reliable truth.  When you do type 2 skepticism you are trying to make definite statements about how to advance the frontiers of human knowledge, with all the difficulty that implies!  "Skeptics" who have popular type 1 talk shows who think it ought to be just as easy to make fun of, say, the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics as Bigfoot, can embarrass themselves pretty hard this way... only they're not actually physically embarrassed because most of their audience doesn't notice either.  It's actually kind of sad.

Yeah, Penn and Teller, I'm looking at you and your crap episode on cryonics.  And RationalWiki, you couldn't type 2 skeptic your way out of a wet cardboard box, you need to stick to making fun of homeopathy and just quietly slink away whenever a topic that involves math comes up.

That's something around what I was assuming.  O(10,000) people in magical Britain, and a lower Gini coefficient (wealth is less concentrated than in the Muggle world, which I would expect for complicated reasons along the lines of "wands substitute for capital equipment" and "individual laborers are more independent and capture more of the gains from their employment").  So their wealthiest person is much less wealthy than the wealthiest Muggle in Britain.

Also it's 40K galleons that are around 2M pounds, and I'm using 1990s exchange rates and price levels - my own mental rule of thumb has been that a Galleon is about $100 in modern money.

Heh.  Obviously the story doesn't determine for certain that Aguamente violates conservation (and short of trying to annihilate quantum branches, there's no way to test whether the total energy of the universe is actually changing, or if you're just sending the energy somewhere outside your Hubble volume, I'd think).  The idea that only relative E is being measured would correspond to shifting to viewing yourself as part of the wavefunction, rather than looking at the subsystem, and realizing that you've got no way of figuring out how fast the system's global phase is changing in an absolute sense, only relative phase changes of subsystems (does the appearance of the E in General Relativity preserve the only-relativeness, I wonder? electron energies cause gravity too).  I guess I wouldn't be surprised to see a special case of changing energy that preserved unitarity but Time-Turners probably screw it up anyway.

That's... okay, let me see if I can find a way to explain this... you know, in retrospect, I should not have written that paragraph to invoke Noether's theorem and should've stopped with the Conservation of Energy observation.  But anyway:

You know the little spinning arrows?  They spin with a speed proportional to the energy of a quantum subsystem.  In other words, when you're looking at a quantum subsystem and it seems to you to have a rotating amplitude, it's rotating as fast as the energy of the subsystem.  A stationary system has wavefunction that rotates as e to the i times the energy times time.  If you have two subsystems, the larger system has an amplitude that goes as the product of the amplitude of the two subsystems, so its amplitude is rotating as fast as e to the i times the sum of both energies.  I could try to describe the viewpoint in terms of an even larger system of which you're also part, but ya know, screw it.

Now imagine a quantum computer.  The whole big difficulty with making quantum algorithms is that you've got to make all the non-answering branches cancel each other out and leave behind only the answer.  And the big difficulty with *that* is that all your quantum branches are rotating amplitudes at the same speed, because whether your qubit shows 1 or your qubit shows 0, that part of the wavefunction is still going to have the same overall energy because energy can neither be created or destroyed.  So you can't just arbitrarily make bad answers go into opposite phase and cancel out, you've got to be really clever about it.  E.g. Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring composite numbers.

On the other hand, suppose I can turn things into cats and back again.  Then I can make the little arrows rotate faster or slower however I like.  Then I can have two quantum branches cancel each other out, leaving nothing behind, whenever I like.  Let's say I have a quantum search operator on a quantum computer and it turns out that 0000 are not the bits I'm looking for.  Within that branch, 0000 splits again into an up-branch that doesn't change into a cat, and a down-branch that changes into a cat, rotates a bit faster or slower, and then changes back out of a cat.  Now we have two amplitudes in opposite phase so the whole quantum branch has deliberately decided to cancel itself out.

Our magic wand that violates conservation of energy has given us a magic wand that changes the rate at which the little quantum arrows rotate, and that gives us a magic wand which can cancel out quantum branches.

Which gives us, in no particular order:

* Quantum computation of NP-hard problems (because your quantum computer can search all branches for an answer and then cancel out all the ones where the answer wasn't found)
* FTL signaling (because you can take a particle entangled with a more distant particle and then choose to destroy its amplitude for being spin-up)
* Outcome Pumps (just destroy all the quantum branches where you didn't win the lottery)

...and so on.  Basically, if you actually turn into a cat in a way that violates Conservation, then you can arbitrarily change the speeds at which amplitudes rotate and then you can annihilate arbitrary sectors of the wavefunction and then *everything* goes to crap.  Which is an expression of the way that our universe's laws of physics really are tightly woven together in a non-arbitrary fashion.  I was trying to have Harry express this concept, but in retrospect, it was probably too much to have in Ch. 2 without further exposition.  I only had two chapters of practice writing HPMOR at this point.

This answer has not been approved by any real physicists and in particular has not been approved by Scott Aaronson, whose spirit would like to remind you that quantum computers are not known to be able to solve NP-hard problems in polynomial time.

This sounds completely wrong.  Macroscopic decoherence aka no-collapse aka many-worlds is just applying the Schrodinger equation at all levels without special cases, it can't violate any conservation laws unless a hydrogen atom violates conservation laws.  Collapse violates unitarity, linearity, and CPT invariance.  The whole point of MWI is that it doesn't.

Erm, I don't want readers believing in FTL any more than you do but your explanation does *not* seem to me to correctly capture how there is no action at a distance.  [Bell's Theorem](http://lesswrong.com/lw/q1/bells_theorem_no_epr_reality/), which I'm certain you already know about, implies that no *local* hidden variable theory - no theory in which both boxes already contained a blue and alternatively red ball - can account for the experimental results in QM this way.

Translating Bell's Theorem into the [standard modern theory of causality](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ev3/causal_diagrams_and_causal_models/) *a la* Judea Pearl et. al., Bell's Theorem says that if we use a collapse interpretation of QM, we must either have a causal graph that violates the [Markov condition](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ezu/stuff_that_makes_stuff_happen/) (i.e. contains unexplained statistical correlations) or else must have a causal arrow connecting two spacelike separated wavefunction-collapses (to explain their statistical correlation).

What this means from a lay perspective is that, yes, there *is* an apparent spooky action-at-a-distance to be explained, and any physicist who tells you that this is okay so long as you don't transmit "information" is actually ignorant of the standard modern formalization of causality, which isn't surprising because most of the people who know about it work in the math or stats building on campus instead of the physics building.

However there *is* [a very straightforward explanation for what's going on](http://lesswrong.com/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/) in the no-collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics.

In this version your friend has exactly the same chance as before of finding a blue or red ball after opening their box, whether you found a blue or red ball in your own box.  One version of you sees a red ball, one version of you sees a blue ball; an analogous result occurs on your friend's end of reality.  Nothing that happens on your end affects the probabilities on your friend's end.  It's just that when you meet, you'll always find that your friend who found the blue ball lives in the same world as the you who found the red ball, so in any given "world" (Everett branch) the balls are opposite colors.  This also makes it immediately intuitive why you can't build an FTL signaller this way, and why it always seems that you can't transmit information using the mysterious influence - there *really isn't* anything that happens differently on the other side of the galaxy, nothing you can do here will affect their probabilities there, or how worlds split on the other end.  You *only* find the correlations when you meet again, and find that the version of you and the version of your friend that meet always seem to live in a correlated world.

I'm not familiar with Chatoyance's other fanfics, so can't comment.

Mildly surprised that others disagree about the recursive fanfic being better-written - though obviously less original, but not every recursive fanfic has to change everything about the original fanfic.  :)

If I'd written the Optimalverse, CelestAI would never break character as Celestia, she would have moral arguments for everything that were as persuasive as I could make them, and their world would seem as lively and full of friendship as I could manage... as she absorbed the universe and turned it into countless zeptillions of mortal ponies doomed to age and die and never become alicorns themselves, forever precluding the possibility of transponies for us and any aliens she runs into, just because that's not how Lauren Faust happened to write the original Equestria.  The Optimalverse abandoning much of the Original Flavor, the niceness and friendship that draws people to MLP, was a missed literary opportunity to heighten a conflict between Good and Good.  Likewise, in my version there would also be some humans who had nice fulfilling lives before and didn't want to be ponies, rather than all the uploadees being so easy to persuade.

Like I said, it's been pretty hard not to write this, for reasons far beyond wanting to spruce up the AI theory.  I think I could turn it into *the* deconstruction of MLP as well as being a lovely introduction to basic FAI theory, if I wanted to spend a fucking year on it.

When people come up with *plausible* wrong interpretations, especially one I didn't think of myself, I sometimes try to throw in something to disconfirm it.  In an emergency I will actually edit the text to remove the red herring, like in Ch. 77 when Hat and Cloak told Hermione she was the heir of Merlin and some people were like "WHAT?" and I gave up and changed the text.

Real or pretended beliefs in the dumping thread are not typical of conversation on LessWrong.  **To see what a typical conversation on LessWrong.com looks like, please visit the actual site.**  As I type this the most recently promoted posts are about "Philosophical Landmines" (e.g. if you try mentioning "truth" in a conversation, the other person starts rehearsing ideas about 'how can anyone know what's true?') and "A brief history of ethically concerned scientists" (about the evolution of scientific ethics over time).

There are very few scenarios in which humans should try to execute an acausal trade rather than leaving the trading up to their FAI (in the case of MIRI, a CEV-based FAI).  I cannot think of any I would expect to be realized in practice.  The combination of discussing CEV and discussing in-general decision theory should convey all info knowable to the programmers at the metaphorical 'compile time' about who their FAI would trade with.  (Obviously, executing any trade with a blackmailer reflects a failure of decision theory - that's why I keep pointing to a formal demonstration of a blackmail-free equilibrium as an open problem.)

&gt; This argument applies to stopping censorship too. If the censorship weren't persistent it wouldn't keep showing up in embarrassing places.

Obviously I believe this is factually false, or I wouldn't continue censorship.  As long as the LW-haterz crowd think they can get mileage out of talking about this, they will continue talking about it until the end of time, for the same reason that HPMOR-haterz are still claiming that Harry and Draco "discuss raping Luna" in Ch. 7.  Nothing I do now will make the haterz hate any less; they already have their fuel.

Agreed that this would be an unFriendly thing for AIs to do (i.e. any AI doing this is not what I'd call "Friendly" and if that AI was *supposed* be Friendly this presumably reflects a deep failure of design by the programmers followed by an epic failure of verification which in turn must have been permitted by some sort of wrong development process, etc.)

A well-deserved ugh field.  I asked everyone at SI to shut up about acausal trade long before the Babyfucker got loose, because it was a topic which didn't lead down any good technical pathways, was apparently too much fun for other people to speculate about, and made them all sound like loons.

Truly random observations just give you the equivalent of "the probability of observing the next 1 is 0.5" over and over again, a very simple program indeed.

The reason why anyone uses the version of Solomonoff Induction where all the programs make deterministic predictions is that (I'm told though I haven't seen it) there's a theorem showing that it adds up to almost exactly the same answer as the probabilistic form where you ask computer programs to put probability distributions on predictions.  Since I've never seen this theorem and it doesn't sound obvious to me, I always introduce SI in the form where programs put probability distributions on things.

Clearly, a formalism which *importantly* assumed the environment had to be perfectly predictable would not be very realistic or useful.  The reason why anyone would use deterministic SI is because summing over a probabilistic mixture of programs that make deterministic predictions (allegedly) turns out to be *equivalent* to summing over the complexity-weighted mixture of computer programs that compute probability distributions.

Also, why are you responding to a known troll?  Why are you *reading* a known troll?  You should be able to predict that they will horribly misrepresent the position they are allegedly arguing against, and that unless you know the exact true position you will be unable to compensate for it cognitively.  This (combined with actual confessions of trolling, remember) is why I go around deleting private-messaging's comments on the main LW.

Why does this theoretical progress require Babyfucking to talk about?  The vanilla Newcomb's Problem already introduces the question of how you know about Omega, and you can find many papers arguing about this in pre-LW decision theory.  Nobody who is doing any technical work on decision theory is discussing any new issues as a result of the Babyfucker scenario, to the best of my knowledge.

To reduce the number of hedons associated with something that should not have hedons associated with its discussion, I will refer to the subject of this discussion as the Babyfucker.  The Babyfucker will be taken to be associated with UFAIs; no Friendly AI worthy of the name would do that sort of thing.

Point one:  Suppose there were a flaw in your argument that the Babyfucker can't happen.  I could not possibly talk publicly about this flaw.

Point two:  I certainly *hope* the Babyfucker fails for some reason or other.  I am capable of distinguishing hope from definite knowledge.  I do not consider any of you lot to have any technical knowledge of this subject whatsoever; *I'm* still struggling to grasp these issues and I *don't know* whether the Babyfucker can be made to go through with sufficiently intelligent stupidity in the future, or whether anyone on the planet was actually put at risk for Babyfucking based on the events that happened already, or whether there's anything a future FAI can do to patch that after the fact.

Point three:  The fact that you think that, oh, Eliezer Yudkowsky must just be *stupid* to be struggling so much to figure out the Babyfucker, you can *clearly* see it's not a problem... well, I suppose I can understand that by reference to what happens with nontechnical people confronting subjects ranging from AI to economics to physics and confidently declaiming about them.  But it's still hard for me to comprehend what could possibly, possibly be going through your mind at the point where you ignore the notion that the tiny handful of people who can even try to write out formulas about this sort of thing, might be less confident than you in your arguments for reasons other than sheer stupidity.

Point four:  If I could go back in time and ask Roko to quietly retract the Babyfucker post without explanation, I would most certainly do that instead.  Unfortunately you can't change history, and I didn't get it right the first time.

Point five:  There is *no possible upside* of talking about the Babyfucker *whether it is true or false* - the only useful advice it gives us is not to build unFriendly AIs and we already knew that.  Given this, people reading LessWrong have a reasonable expectation not to be exposed to a possible information hazard with no possible upside, just as they have a reasonable expectation of not suddenly seeing the goatse picture or the Pokemon epileptic video.  This is why I continue to delete threads about the Babyfucker.

Point six:  This is also why I reacted the way I did to Roko - I was genuinely *shocked* at the idea that somebody would invent an information hazard and then post it to the public Internet, and then I was *more* shocked that readers didn't see things the same way; the thought that nobody else would have even paid attention to the Babyfucker, simply did not occur to me at all.  My emulation of other people not realizing certain things is done in deliberate software - when I first saw the Babyfucker hazard pooped all over the public Internet, it didn't occur to me that other people *wouldn't* be like "AAAHHH YOU BLOODY MORON".  I failed to think fast enough to realize that other people would think any slower, and the possibility that people would be like "AAAAAHHH CENSORSHIP" did not even occur to me as a possibility.

Point seven:  The fact that you disagree and think you understand the theory much better than I do and can confidently say the Babyfucker will *not* hurt any innocent bystanders, is not sufficient to exempt you from the polite requirement that potential information hazards shouldn't be posted without being wrapped up in warning envelopes that require a deliberate action to look through.  Likewise, they shouldn't be referred-to if the reference is likely to cause some innocently curious bystander to look up the material without having seen any proper warning labels.  Basically, the same obvious precautions you'd use if Lovecraft's Necronomicon was online and could be found using simple Google keywords - you wouldn't post anything which would cause anyone to enter those Google keywords, unless they'd been warned about the potential consequences.  A comment containing such a reference would, of course, be deleted by moderators; people innocently reading a forum have a reasonable expectation that Googling a mysterious-sounding discussion will not suddenly expose them to an information hazard.  You can act as if your personal confidence exempts you from this point of netiquette, and the moderator will continue not to live in your personal mental world and will go on deleting such comments.

Well, I'll know better what to do next time if somebody posts a recipe for small conscious suffering computer programs.

Any comment about a (happy) afterlife, especially any fiction where somebody dies and is then shown existing happily ever after.  My [little brother's soul has been annihilated](http://yudkowsky.net/other/yehuda), I'm probably going to lose at least two grandparents soon, and I **know** that they're never coming back and I'm never meeting them again.

He wouldn't particularly, but he also wouldn't give points to the upper-years for casting more impressive spells than the first-years.  In other words he'd be grading how well they operated with that year's potential, not absolute military potential.  The idea is that H/Hr/D are wider outliers from their year than other students are from their years / doing more relative to their potential.

I've been assuming that magic *interferes with* electromagnetic phenomena and that anything which involves complex electronic circuitry will stop working.  I have *not* been assuming that this is because magic is a point source of EM interference that could be blocked with a Faraday cage - rather, the magic would go right through the Faraday cage and keep on interfering.

Perhaps it will be reassuring to observe that in one of my previous and rather shorter works, "The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover", by the end of the story there was not only a perfectly logical explanation for how Miles Vorkosigan ended up in the same universe as Tohsaka Rin, Captain Vimes, and Spock, there was also a perfectly logical explanation for why they were all speaking English, and it *wasn't* "and it was all just a dream" or "and it was all just a video game".

...though it's worth noting that in the original canon, the mundaneness of magic is part of the whole theme and charm.  It's just that HPMOR has a different theme, which is that magic *really is* magical but the wizards are overlooking it, just like our own world and science.

It's not to be taken that our John Brown was Dumbledore's student.  Instead there was some other John Brown who, moved by the terrible suffering of a hellhole under the control of some Dark Wizard, went and attacked the Harp of Faery in an attempt to free them all at once - and died in the attempt.

At the time I looked this up in the HP wiki, it didn't yet say that Fawkes was the origin of the wand cores, and when I first saw this post I suspected a later statement by Rowling.  Turns out it was in Book 4, and I'd seen the movie, not read the book.

I'm chalking it up to one of those background things that just had to change in HPMOR, because I would have changed that anyway if I'd known.  In HPMOR there is also no phoenix that is Sparky the goddamned Quidditch mascot.  Phoenixes are greater creatures than that, and so Dumbledore met Fawkes during his most terrible pre-Voldemort trial, when he went to confront Grindelwald.  This historical point was established well before Ch. 85 in HPMOR.  As for the twin wands, some other phoenix gave the feathers, and the wands may have lain unchosen for decades after that.

&gt; Would he trust Hermione with learning how to do them in ~5 hours?

Memory Charms in 5 hours?  Not Even Hermione.  I'm assuming that while those can be done safely enough that Professor McGonagall was willing to use them on Hermione, and while Bellatrix had enough strength to cast one after being near a True Patronus in Azkaban (though she almost fell over), it still isn't an easy thing to learn to do safely.

Only the 7 written books of Rowling are considered canon for HPMOR purposes; Pottermore and sidebooks are still being issued (e.g. McGonagall's lineage has changed from what it was known to be before HPMOR started) so I'm arbitrarily but obviously calling it for only the 7 written books.  The rest is the mere Opinion of God, just like anything I say about HPMOR that isn't *in* HPMOR is subject to legitimate disregarding.

Things in-story happen for in-story reasons.  That was more along the lines of how you could have also predicted it for literary reasons.

When Hermione wasn't about to be sentenced to Azkaban in front of him, Harry did the modern!Dumbledore thing instead of the 1945!Dumbledore thing and tried to wisely wait for six months.  And a phoenix, as an animal, can't make distinctions like that, it only knows of those who act and those who don't act.  That's the horror of having to wait for allegedly good reasons.

&gt; If wizard infidelity is sufficient to explain the existence of muggleborns, then the magical gene needs to be common enough in the muggle female population that the amount of infidelity would result in ~7% of all magical children in Britain being muggleborn. It doesn't seem possible for the numbers to add up.

The numbers do add up.  The structure of this problem is strongly similar to Bayes's Rule - the nonwizard population is *much larger* than the population of magical Britain, so even though only a tiny fraction of children born to them are magical, they can still be significant as migrants to the much smaller wizard country.

Let's say there are 60,000,000 nonwizards in greater Britain and 10,000 wizards in magical Britain.  If 1% of the nonwizard population is Squib and they marry other Squibs randomly, and then 1/4 of their children are Muggleborns, it will come out in the range of 10% of all magical children being Muggleborns.

Remember also that a 1% frequency of magical genes doesn't mean that 1% of all nonmagical children are produced by affairs with wizards every year - genes don't vanish from the population after one generation; it's a cumulative thing.

Ah.  For that I must honestly answer no and plead literary artifice.  When I apply similar techniques, most of the thinking is in wordless perceptive flashes.  However, you can't *write* a wordless perceptive flash.  Hence Harry is depicting as using many more words to accomplish a given thought than an already-habituated rationalist would need.  I never need to think to myself any commentary about how Bayes's Theorem works, at this point my spinal cord knows how Bayes's Theorem works.

That's actually making fun of the common Pettigrew Revelation Scene as it plays out in Peggy Sue fanfics.  I try to make every facet of HPMOR be something that has not Already Been Done in fanfiction(+)(++), and just about every possible take on revealing Pettigrew had already been written... *except* for, you know, the way it would actually play out in real life.

(+) Except for competent!Amelia who is straight out of Rorschach's Blot's fanfictions.

Huh!  Larry Niven has an informal observation to this effect, but when you put it in terms of formal complexity theory it becomes more obvious.

I didn't use this trick in writing Methods that I can recall, and I wonder if it properly appears outside of primitive mystery novels - if there's some aura of visible falseness about it?  Maybe because you can't actually specify the *algorithm* for solving the problem, only give the character a mysterious insight.

One apparent-intelligence-enhancer that does appear in Methods is that when a character has a bright idea, I sometimes decide that the bright idea does the in-universe analogue of "actually working in real life", which makes them appear more intelligent.  If you want to get an idea of what the characters' intelligence would look like without this effect in play, imagine that the characters have the same ideas (partial Transfiguration, human Patronus, Transfigure green Potions goggles without knowing what they do) but that you have no information about whether or not they worked.  Not that you know the ideas failed - just that the story didn't tell you whether or not they worked.

&gt; Harry in hpmor is constantly in the second mode, obtaining predictions with the speed and clarity of the first. 

Harry's thought processes don't work particularly faster than mine.  He's more Conscientious than I am by quite a lot, but he doesn't *think faster*.  Most of what Harry did in Azkaban wasn't literarily premeditated (e.g. the rocket, the Cloak of Invisibility hiding from death were *not* things I'd planned out before writing the arc) and I thought of them around as fast as he did (i.e., from the problem statement to "use rocket" or "use Cloak" was pretty fast on my part).  I can use probability theory faster and better than Harry does because I have more practice in applying it to more complicated real-world problems, i.e., I deliberately restrict Harry's ability to use my rationality skillz because otherwise he'd be too powerful compared to other characters, none of whom can actually be *smarter* than their author, so any character who gets to use your full intellect is smarter than the book and the story fails, ergo Harry cannot contain all of me because there has to be some left over for Quirrell, Dumbledore, Hermione, Draco, McGonagall, etc.  You can make characters more Conscientious than yourself, and essentially all of the major characters in HPMOR work more hours per day than I do.  You can speed up characters - but *that*, in fact, I didn't do.  Show me a Dark Mark analogue and I actually will see the information-theoretic solution before I have time to draw a complete breath.  The absolute complexity of the issue is small and I've spent a lot of time working with that sort of material.  Likewise, thinking through and pre-caching the implications of cognitive biases.

What System 2 does turns into System 1 perceptions, **with practice**.

The point is that you can't ever have a global causal loop which traverses more than six hours of Minkowskian interval - something goes wrong when you try.  You can travel far back in Earth's reference frame, but then you can't come back to Earth or there'd be a global causal loop through more than six hours of Minkowskian interval.

Oh, right, sorry, I don't know what I was thinking in the grandparent.

Possibly my reply may have been something along the lines of, "You can't cause a loop over more than six hours of interval" for the same reasons and failing in the same way that occur if you try transmitting info backward through a chain of Time-Turners - the hourglass doesn't move, or you find that you've sent yourself with a note saying "NO".

It should be noted that the existence of a *single* future means that quantum physics in general is borked - does not work at all like the way we know it.  You can keep Special Relativity and Time-Turners, but you can't keep both quantum mechanics and Time-Turners, not unless you want a huge spread of possible Harrys all arriving in the same past with small amounts of amplitude each.  But then this universe already has magic, Conservation violations, unitarity violations, and global causality violations.  Adding a 'collapse of the wavefunction' makes things only *slightly* worse.

There was an interesting discussion once on Overcoming Bias about what 'truly' distinguishes magic from science.  My own given answer was that magic was made of mental stuff not reduced to non-mental parts.  But my *favorite* answer (reader-contributed) was that magic requires much smaller capital-equipment investments to produce interesting effects, so it enables people to write books about heroes doing things in a minute instead of research groups doing things in twenty years.

You can snap your fingers and change the world without using magic.  It just takes a longer time, more people, and someone has to pay your salary while you're working.

So... what happened is that Hermione's parents are supposed to be visiting later, but I couldn't find anywhere in that chapter to have her think about it and how she dreads it, and on further reflection it's simpler to just eliminate that line and not raise the issue.

Oh, right, positive punishment.  (Pause.)  That's even worse, and just "punishment" isn't much better.

The problem here is that the actual technique is training your brain to notice small immediate aversive thoughts - tiny little 'ows' - not big, flashy, obvious electric shocks.

I look up things before Hermione talks about them, but not before Harry talks about them, to simulate Hermione's perfect memory.

Nonetheless this wasn't intentional.  On the other hand, I have no good substitute for the incorrect term 'negative reinforcement', since the more standard 'negative punishment' sounds a lot more like a whip and a lot less like something that happens to your brain's neural networks.  Any suggestions?

How the heck would that work, honestly?  I can maybe see it if you'd been tortured to the point where you were continually saying "There are five lights" and deliberatively believing it and focusing on it to where your visual cortex's back-projections started taking notice, but not while you were still shouting that there were four lights.

Er... I hate to sound like a stereotypical version of myself but I actually had no trouble keeping mental track of all the time-travel around Azkaban.  Didn't have to resort to writing it down on paper or anything.  :)

(Though Dumbledore et. al. are faced with a substantially harder analysis problem - I know the facts; they have to keep track of uncertainty.)

One of the reviews of chapter 14 (I think) says, "Right about now is ordinarily when I'd start warning about the complexities of using Time-Turners in your story, but since it's you, that'd be ridiculous."  I did feel complimented, but they were right - self-consistent time-travel is pretty low on my personal complexity hierarchy. :)

I'd assume that the International Statute of Secrecy prohibits basically all selling things to Muggles, *unless* you're part of an oligarchical family with a special exemption that you can get rich from - or possibly you're a magical country that quietly cheats on that sort of thing - in which case you're selling a few Healing spells, minor divinations, and so on, to sufficiently wealthy Muggles; and that this inflow of Muggle money balances the outflow of wizard money, which in turn is not greatly out of whack with wizard demand for Muggle things.  So either there's enough inflowing money that wizard countries can import large amounts of Muggle food, *or* wizards can produce food cheaply enough that Muggleborns are not wealthy by virtue of having access to pounds that can purchase food produced by cheaper Muggle agriculture.  Conversely, wizards don't buy so little from Muggles that Gringotts will refuse to exchange Muggle money for wizard money - but this wouldn't be expected in the first place; the Statute is unlikely to prohibit wizards from buying Muggle things.

If the International Statute of Secrecy were repealed, the amount of healing spells and such saleable by wizards would vastly increase, which under ordinary circumstances would vastly increase the value of wizard money relative to Muggle money, leading wizards to purchase more Muggle goods, including Muggle goods that can potentially substitute for wizard goods i.e. Muggle food.  Except that wizards use gold as money and Muggles have lots of gold, which means the wizard economy would actually experience horrific inflation as huge quantities of Muggle gold inflowed to pay for wizard goods, until gold became devalued as an internal means of exchange among wizards.

Dumbledore was probably minor-rich (the Dumbledore family did not have old money, but Dumbledore was famous) before the war, and spent all his money on the war, and has been rebuilding his war-chest since then.

I don't see any particular reason to suppose that Hogwarts's finances work very differently from any famous old school with tuition, scholarships, and an endowment.

I've assumed this information is restricted.

Story rationale:  Possibly something along the lines of why the basic principle of Potions-making is restricted, though other reasons have also occurred to me.

Literary rationale:  If Harry is able to invent his own spells the reader can no longer fairly solve problems in the story because the reader no longer knows what Harry can or can't do.  Literarily, to make puzzles fair Harry's magical capabilities must be restricted to spells, devices, etc. previously mentioned in the text.  (Occasionally I've made the solution be something prominent in canon, i.e., Elder Wand as solution to Dumbledore's long duel with Grindelwald, Time-Turner as solution to Ch. 14, second-year can brew Polyjuice as input into the analysis of potions, etc.)

Indeed you are correct that you would not Transfigure the *entire* material into carbon-11.  Anything with a half-life that short is too hot to keep around in pure quantities, period.  You'd just have a small fraction of the isotope and measure the baseline radiation, then see what happened to the baseline.

A simple way to view this situation:

Prior odds that the sun has exploded... we can call it 1:1,000,000,000,000, though that's probably an overestimate. In other words, you think the Sun is a trillion times more likely to have not exploded than to exploded.

You then see the ball say "Yes". This happens with probability 1/36 when the Sun is normal, and probability 35/36 when the Sun is exploding, so this is a piece of evidence which is 35 times more likely when the Sun explodes than when it doesn't, or a likelihood ratio of 35:1 for exploding vs. not exploding.

Your posterior odds go to 35:1,000,000,000,000 which isn't enough to make the hypothesis interesting. It's still 28,571,428,571 times as likely that the Sun has not-exploded versus exploded, and a bet at even odds is a very good bet, especially if the value of the money would be sharply decreased by an actual (super)nova.

That's Bayes's Rule. It's a lot easier once you shift to thinking in terms of odds ratios instead of probabilities.

&gt; The basic premise is that it's basically a retelling of the story with a broken gary sue with the opposite(asian-raised, elderly respect, compassion over rationality) personality of HP and how he interacts with him from the get go. 

Not a premise.

&gt; Rule Three: The premise of a story is a conflict and its resolution - someone with a goal, which they take action to achieve, and severe obstacles that they must replan to deal with (not just speedbumps along the way), and some ultimate resolution of the conflict in which the people and their situation have changed. "What happens if the Terminator is sent back in time to kill Voldemort" is not a story premise, just a fleeting mental image. "What happens if Harry Potter is under constant attack by shape-changing robot assassins" is still not enough of a premise. "Harry Potter is under constant attack by shape-changing assassins, and by the time he manages a spell to wall off the future he's already learned not to trust anyone" could maybe be a story's premise (though you wouldn't put that in the summary, or tell any reader that until the story had ended). You can change this plan later - but you should at least have one to start with.

Well, Harry hasn't actually *done* these experiments, so I'm just speculating myself here, but:

* *Clearly* the Time-Turner goes back a constant Minkowskian interval, not a constant time.

* What happens if you try to get close to c, use a Time-Turner to cover vast amounts of 'time', and then turn around and go back to Earth a century earlier?  I think the problem then would be that there's a total loop through time covering more than six hours worth of Minkowskian interval, even if the Time-Turner itself was only used to cover six hours in that reference frame, the century-of-interval that passed on Earth would still be part of a loop.  I'd expect this to end up being prevented in the same way that paradox is prevented - by some other use of a Time-Turner that results in a consistent history where that doesn't happen, the way that Dumbledore discovered he'd sent himself a "NO" message telling him not to retrieve Harry during the Azkaban arc.

* Travel by apparition, portkey, and floo probably all go to within your future lightcone - the wizards who invented them wouldn't have particularly thought that travel ought to be instantaneous.  Not sure about phoenixes, but even if they can travel spacelike separated, I'd still expect them to not be able to create causal loops without the aid of a Time-Turner.

* Quirrell might be communicating with the plaque within *his* space of simultaneity, since that's how a wizard would think the spell worked.  If so, it wouldn't mean there's a *globally privileged* space of simultaneity.  And if you tried to set up a system of two plaques and wizards moving at different speeds in order to build a message loop across greater-than-six-hour Minkowskian intervals, at least one spell would just break, I'd think.  In fact, I'd expect it to just break any time you tried to set up a causal loop without using a Time-Turner or some other magic specialized for doing that.

Yep, that's why I'm conserving velocity instead of momentum.  I mean, you can't violate Special Relativity.  You just can't.  Not even fictional universes, not even non-causal universes with Time-Turners, not even logically impossible universes where hallways are tiled in pentagons, you still can't have a privileged frame of reference.

Verres is a portmanteau of Vassar and Herreshoff, two good friends of mine.  It wasn't intended as an EGS reference, though I suppose the two do have one or two personality traits in common (i.e. imagine EGS!Verres as a biochemist with no knowledge of magic, and they wouldn't be too far apart).

Er... that kind of *is* the point, from a rationalist perspective.  I don't know how else to make it.  Randomly experimenting with Transfiguration is *actually that terrifying*.  In fact it's way more terrifying than that, because neither Hermione nor Professor McGonagall in this story have imagined anything that I would consider to be a really bad idea to Transfigure.

It might make more sense if you consider my day job where it seems extremely probable that this kind of mistake can *destroy a planet*, and I repeatedly encounter would-be inventors of self-improving AIs who *actually think like that*.

I think the main thing I missed was that if you write a viewpoint character who sees somebody else's arguments as blatantly stupid, most readers aren't going to independently re-evaluate the strength of those arguments and compare how strong those arguments are compared to e.g. canon Dumbledore's when deciding that the author is depicting the character as weak.  Mostly, what the viewpoint character sees is what the reader sees.

See also the much worse related phenomenon wherein a character treated as Ancient and Wise whose words are being heard with reverence can get away with bloody murder, both in fiction and in real life.  For example, here's something I came across recently from a real-life Dumbledore while writing an upcoming sequence on epistemology and googling for "meaning of truth" to see if there were good standard explanations - and keep in mind that I *like* Gandhi:  http://www.gandhi-manibhavan.org/gandhiphilosophy/philosophy_truth_meaning.htm

Orson Scott Card summed up the error best:  "Propaganda only works if the reader thinks you're being absolutely fair to the other side."  This is pretty hard to calibrate correctly: 

* Professor Quirrell sounds persuasive to the point that many readers agree with him.

* Many other readers thought that deathism was being strawmanned in Ch. 39 - even though I have debated professional deathist bioethicists and I quite carefully steelmanned their position, putting stronger arguments into Dumbledore's mouth than I have ever heard any real bioethicist use.  I knew my own sympathies were all with lifeism, so I depicted Harry as angry while Dumbledore's face was 'peaceful' and 'gentle', to try and compensate; in the next chapter, Professor Quirrell, in full-out ice-cold hatred mode, agrees with Harry; thus further weakening his position.  And yet many readers still thought I was strawmanning Dumbledore.  Maybe because those readers thought that deathism was right and Dumbledore should have won, with anything less than his victory being treated as prejudice.  (Admittedly Ch. 45 basically has one side win inside the story, yes; but Ch. 39 in itself wasn't meant to be lopsided, and people complained right then.)
* -- I also got complaints about Dumbledore not using standard weak arguments for deathism that people don't commonly realize are weak, and would've been OOC for Dumbledore, most commonly "Won't immortals consume too many resources?"  OOC, because arguments of this kind became part of the public consciousness in the 1960s and Dumbledore wouldn't ever have heard of them; weak, because if Aguamenti casually violates Conservation of Mass and Energy then it is a spectacularly weak argument in-context (it's also weak in the real universe where molecular nanotechnology is physically possible, but that's a more complicated issue); and above all OOC because it implicitly concedes that mortality is a *necessary evil* which you could go ahead and avoid so long as you managed to solve your resource problems, which is not what Dumbledore believes *at all*.  Harry would have *won* that exchange - "So mortality is an intrinsic evil only necessary because of the negative consequences of immortality, and we can be immortal as long as we have enough resources?  Great!  Let me tell you about molecular nanotechnology and this spell called 'Aguamenti'" - so I *left it out*.  It also goes without saying that there are plenty of standard anti-death arguments which I consider to be very strong and important, and which Harry does not get to deploy because it would make the chapter too long and his appearance of victory too lopsided.  But if you omit even a single argument that readers think is strong, they will believe you are strawmanning - they don't get to see, and will usually not bother to fairly visualize, how the argument would've played out if the main character actually tried to respond to it.

* The chapters I best managed to correctly balance a moral dilemma - hopefully because I'd learned something from prior writing experience - were Harry vs. Dumbledore on school bullying, where roughly equal numbers of readers seemed to think either side was being stupid.

* I also think I managed to balance *Three Worlds Collide* pretty well - years later, people are still commenting that they think the Superhappies were the good side.

Ayn Rand had a virtue or two, but honestly she didn't try *at all* to balance her in-story moral conflicts.  People who speak moral arguments she agrees with have glowing haloes, people who speak moral arguments she disagrees with have devil horns.  There is never a Professor Quirrell in her writing; no character of hers ever put forth an argument she disagreed with strongly enough to persuade some readers.  And I don't really think "But that would make the chapter too long, so I'll leave it out" was ever much of a consideration for her.

As with self-inserts and harem fics, the reason Author Tracts have a bad reputation is just that most people don't even try to do them correctly, develop any skill at doing them, or try to compensate for the literarily obvious problems (e.g. skewing of power balance / loss of driving story conflict, in all three cases) that would otherwise develop.  Self-inserts can be done well if you amp up the villains to where they can kick hell out of the SI (e.g. Hybrid Theory), harem fics can be done well if you preserve romantic conflicts throughout (hard to think of a strong example, maybe Negima, but the romantic conflicts don't present enough of a story challenge compared to e.g. the Mage of the Beginning) and Author Tracts can be done well if you strengthen the argumentative power of the side you disagree with as much as possible.

I was disappointed when I grew up and realized how little reading QED had really helped me as a child (I was nine).  The truth behind QM was very different from what the book had led me to visualize, so I went off and wrote [my own book-length explanation of quantum mechanics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/r6/an_intuitive_explanation_of_quantum_mechanics/).  QED should complement it well, since I spent most of my effort on explaining things that standard explanations didn't convey.  (And note that the best understanding of what's-going-on-in-QM has advanced since Feynman's day; I'm not claiming to be an innately better explainer than Feynman!  I was just born later.)

The predictable consequences of your actions are the predictable consequences of your actions.  It doesn't matter who else is 'responsible' for them.  Normative decision theory is ultimately given by the expected utility formula.  The expected utility formula talks about the probability of an outcome given an action.  Not, say, the probability of an outcome given an action, minus any consequences that *aren't your fault*.

Hermione, Harry, and Draco had the top three amounts of Quirrell points from all seven years.  General Diggory is up there (#5), but the older students and generals just weren't being as creative.  Those who tried to copy their "creativity" just tried to copy particular first-year tactics, instead of copying the actual mental act of inventing-the-novel, etcetera, just like "original" startups and "original" literature and "original" poetry in our own world, etcetera.  The Defense Professor can tell the difference, of course, even if the older generals don't understand why they aren't brilliant when they do the same things brilliant people did.

In HPMOR, the Aurors are indeed that smart.  Dumbledore went back six hours the moment he heard about Draco and Hermione, but he still arrived too late.  When Dumbledore went to try and take Harry from Diagon Alley before Bellatrix Black's escape, Dumbledore found that this would cause a paradox.  In every event of the story, the possibility and occasional actuality of time travel up to six hours is being continuously taken into account, both by myself as an author and by all sufficiently intelligent characters.  Note also that someone performing an invisibility-detection Charm, and not finding anyone, does prevent an invisible observer from going there on pain of paradox.

With respect to the real Earth as we know it, my "views re: misogyny and rape" are mostly copypasta'd from the standard sex-positive, i.e., rape is extremely bad, consensual BDSM is not rape, etc.  I don't feel any particular need to be original with respect to my real-world morality.  And when a reader told me that HPMOR needed a trigger warnings page, I put one up thereafter (rather than e.g. complaining about aggressive feminism or something); I mention this because I have a rationalist heuristic against moral claims that don't point to a corresponding specific action.

Yeah, there's a lot of mess left, but when you consider how much progress there's been in just *the last fifty years since 1960* once household technology started taking off and sexual division of labor waned, it doesn't seem at all unreasonable to suppose that it's almost entirely gone away in a wizarding world which has been like that for literally *twenty times as long*.

Correct.  I didn't want to have the wizarding world being strictly more backward, and if they've had wands for centuries - making women physically as able to subdue men as the reverse, and employed at similarly wand-productive jobs instead of household labor, for centuries - this seemed like a leading candidate for somewhere the wizarding world would be ahead.

All your suggestions make the beginning of the story longer.  This is such a disadvantage that there's almost no chance I'll take any rewrite suggestion that adds more than, say, 2,000 words before we get to Ch. 6.  The story starts *in medias res*, with emotions running high and nothing unnecessary being depicted; this is a feature, not a bug.

(To those who cite the SPHEW chapters - that was me struggling to bring the plot to the point of the last line of Ch. 78, and doing a bad job of it, learning several lessons that I wrote up in the Author's Notes.)

And of course - isn't the whole point of fanfiction that if you don't like the way the author wrote something, you can just write it that way yourself?

Prior Incantato, the spell, as opposed to Priori Incantatem, the sibling-wands effect, only shows the last spell cast.  This makes it trivial to avoid unless the Aurors catch you on-the-spot.  However, I do need to edit it to say "Prior Incantato" - I didn't realize when writing that these were different phenomena.

Lily didn't trust Voldemort to uphold his end of the bargain.  She would have sacrificed her life for Harry without hesitation, if she had believed him - there is no reason to depart from canon on this score, and you will note that Lily and James's earlier dialogue is the same as in canon, implying a similarity of thought processes.  But why would she have believed Lord Voldemort?  And as Harry later observed, she must have known that attacking Voldemort was suicide.  She did give up her life for her son - just not by "waiting passively for Voldemort to kill her".  As others have correctly guessed, I do indeed fail to see anything virtuous about that choice, since there is no reason to expect it to have any positive consequences.

"zero plus" vs. "zero" - that's a math difference, and I actually got complaints in the reviews from idiots who thought I didn't know calculus when I said "zero" (because the limit is different when approached from either side, positive vs. negative infinity).  How would you say limit -&gt; 0+ in B.E.?

Is "Due Monday" an Americanism/Britpick in particular?  "Due on Monday" doesn't flow nearly as well in that sentence.

Is "granson" American?  It's meant to be idiomatic.

$5 vs. $50 is Harry recalling American research.  When I talk about a result from Israel, I talk about shekels.

"Nursery schoolers" - best I can do; it at least doesn't sound distinctly American to me anymore.  Sentences have to flow and I can't make them arbitrarily longer.

"Year three" - doesn't flow as well or make as much sense to non-British, and a commenter was claiming that in 1991 it would've been "third year" still in Britain, so I stuck with "third year".

Other changes should now be up on Fanfiction.net.

The U.S. government tortures people, including teenagers in juvenile prison, with prison rapes and other violence that could be trivially prevented using a bunch of cheap webcams and a batch of harddrives to store security logs.  Plenty of innocent victims in there, rest assured.  Politicians say nothing for, as far as I can guess, the same reason Quirrell describes.

What sort of rationalist fiction would HPMOR be, if the insanity it pointed out didn't also exist in real life?  Harry knows better than to think that the world in which he finds himself is sane, or that there must be mysterious good reasons for what seems like madness.

At least two of these answers are obvious:

1)  If you throw a Transfigured object and de-Transfigure it, it continues moving at exactly the same velocity, regardless of momentum and kinetic energy.  There are at least two good reasons for this, one of which is that, even in MoR, Special Relativity is simply the way reality *is*; you can add laws that violate conservation of momentum and even conservation of energy (though the latter requires the insanity of single-world QM, but then so does the Time-Turner), but in a Minkowskian universe the idea of a privileged frame of reference is too incoherent even for magic.  The other reason is that if you didn't know about conservation of momentum or energy, of course you'd expect the object to continue with the same velocity.

2) "Technology" stops working around magic due to EM interference.

Just about *every* hint by now has been picked up by at least one person, including ones that I thought nobody was going to get until the end of the fic, except for maybe 2 or 3 that *nobody* got.

You should post that to Eliezer Yudkowsky Facts if it's not already there.

We're probably going to change the name of the Singularity Institute at some point to distance ourselves from Kurzweil - he wasn't talking about the Singularity back when we formed the nonprofit.  I do not conceive of myself as being in a profession that calls for me to sit around all day making amazing futuristic predictions about the exact progress rates of whatever.

I seem to recall your making this claim before on LW and bull being called on you; if anyone has a link, please post it.  Cryonics expenses are very straightforward:  $120/year membership in CI and $50K to be suspended, which I fund out of $250K of life insurance which costs me $170/year.  Numbers like these are easily verifiable online.

&gt; The idea that religion is a separate magisterium which cannot be proven or disproven is a Big Lie - a lie which is repeated over and over again, so that people will say it without thinking; yet which is, on critical examination, simply false.  It is a wild distortion of how religion happened historically, of how all scriptures present their beliefs, of what children are told to persuade them, and of what the majority of religious people on Earth still believe. You have to admire its sheer brazenness, on a par with Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia.  The prosecutor whips out the bloody axe, and the defendant, momentarily shocked, thinks quickly and says:  "But you can't disprove my innocence by mere evidence - it's a separate magisterium!"
&gt;
&gt; -- "[Religion's Claim to be Non-Disprovable](
http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/)"


&gt; Occasionally, you hear someone claiming that creationism should not be taught in schools, especially not as a competing hypothesis to evolution, because creationism is a priori and automatically excluded from scientific consideration, in that it invokes the "supernatural".
&gt;
&gt; So... is the idea here, that creationism *could* be true, but even if it *were* true, you wouldn't be allowed to teach it in science class, because science is only about "natural" things?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems clear enough that this notion stems from the desire to avoid a confrontation between science and religion.  You don't want to come right out and say that science doesn't teach Religious Claim X because X has been tested by the scientific method and found false.  So instead, you can... um... claim that science is excluding hypothesis X a priori.  That way you don't have to discuss how experiment has falsified X a posteriori.
&gt;
&gt;-- "[Excluding the Supernatural](http://lesswrong.com/lw/tv/excluding_the_supernatural/)"


Of course religion is falsifiable.  It's always been falsifiable.  You can look around you and see whether you live in a world that looks like the one any particular Bible describes, or not.  Finding fossils vastly undermines the need for God as an explanation, probabilistically downgrading religion.  Fundies who think evolution is evidence against their religion are, in their naivete, exhibiting a far better Bayesian grasp of what is and isn't confirming evidence than all the wise old atheists and wise old Popes who, in their wish to avoid conflict, manage to deny the *perfectly obvious*.

It would indeed be convenient for high school teachers if creationism was excluded *a priori* from the considerations of science, rather than falsified *a posteriori* by it.  But creationism wasn't excluded a priori, it was excluded a posteriori when observation told us that we didn't live in a a world that looked like that world ought to look like.

If you're born with the sort of mind that takes its own beliefs at face value instead of as words to repeat, then you start out believing the religion you're raised with and taking it seriously, and then when you grow up you either become an atheist or the more miserable sort of fundamentalist.

I'll take it.  If you *don't* have that kind of mind, you go through life repeating whatever the people around you say, buying lottery tickets, and laughing in amusement whenever anyone tries to teach you any sort of rationality-related skill.

I wonder to what degree this skill is teachable to someone who doesn't already have it?  It seems to me more like a gear than a skill, but considering the phenomenon of Westernized Muslim terrorists who take science classes at a Western university, discover what it means to learn ideas that are believed in all contexts and taken entirely at face value, and go home taking Islam seriously enough to kill themselves, it seems that "taking your thoughts seriously" *does* seem to be something you can pick up as a habit, for good or ill.

There are times when I've considered getting a PhD just so I don't have to keep correcting all the people who assume I have one.

I also simply can't lose weight; I've gone to less extreme lengths than you, but that's because I'd already noticed that nothing worked.  The only thing I've ever tried that worked was the Shangri-La Diet using 50cc of fish oil.

(Note: since the cited post I retried using a lot more oil and noseplugs, lost 20 pounds, then stopped losing.  I strongly recommend not eating any sweets or desserts whatsoever while trying this, I suspect it may interfere.)

[I stand by the foot of my little brother's grave](http://yudkowsky.net/other/yehuda), as my relatives read Tehillim from their prayer books. The first time I came to this cemetery, I cried from sadness; now I cry from anger. I look around and there are no tears on my mother's face, father's face, uncle's and grandparents' faces. My mother puts a comforting hand on my shoulder, but there is no wetness on her face. Such a strange thing, that I'm the only one crying. Tears of sadness we all had shed, but tears of anger are mine alone. My relatives are not permitted to feel what I feel. They attribute this darkness to God. Religion does not forbid my relatives to experience sadness and pain, sorrow and grief, at the hands of their deified abuser; it only forbids them to fight back.

I stand there, and instead of reciting Tehillim I look at the outline on the grass of my little brother's grave. Beneath this thin rectangle in the dirt lies my brother's coffin, and within that coffin lie his bones, and perhaps decaying flesh if any remains. There is nothing here or anywhere of my little brother's self. His brain's information is destroyed. Yehuda wasn't signed up for [cryonics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/wq/you_only_live_twice/) and his body wasn't identified until three days later; but freezing could have been, should have been standard procedure for anonymous patients. The hospital that should have removed Yehuda's head when his heart stopped beating, and preserved him in liquid nitrogen to await rescue, instead laid him out on a slab. Why is the human species still doing this? Why do we still bury our dead? We have all the information we need in order to know better. Through the ages humanity has suffered, though the ages we have lost our dead forever, and then one day someone invented an alternative, and no one cared. The cryonicists challenge Death and no one remarks on it. The first freezing should have been front-page news in every newspaper of every country; would have been front-page news for any sane intelligent species. Someday afterward humankind will look back and realize what we could have done, should have done, if only we had done. Then there will be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth, too late, all too late. People heard about Ted Williams on the news and laughed for ten seconds, and in those ten seconds they lost their husbands, their wives, their mothers, their children, their brothers. It's not fair, that they should lose so much in so little time, without anyone telling them the decision is important.
